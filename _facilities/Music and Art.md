## Music and Art

### The Learning Gallery

This area is used to conduct Art lessons as well as showcase students' art pieces. Students feel good when their art pieces are displayed and they develop confidence in the process. At the same time, they learn by observing others’ pieces of art. 


### ART AND CRAFTS ROOM

Art and Craft lessons are conducted here. There are doors that lead to the Outdoor Experiential Learning Area. The sinks outside are for washing up and racks are put up for drying art pieces.
