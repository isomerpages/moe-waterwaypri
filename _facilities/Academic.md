## Academic

### CLASSROOMS


![](/images/About%20Us/Academic%20Facilities%201.jpg)

This is a typical classroom. We set up a conducive learning environment in the classroom. Children are seated in groups to facilitate group work.

  

They also come to the front to sit down for some lessons. Children’s work is displayed in the classroom. Class rules are written clearly. There are reading corners so that children can be encouraged to read on their own and with others.



### LEARNING BEHAVIOUR SUPPORT ROOM (LBS)

These rooms are used when we do small group teaching. We have allied educators to teach small groups of students who need more support with their learning. For example, some students with dyslexia might have difficulties with reading while others might have difficulties following lessons in a normal classroom setting.


### MATHEMATICS ROOM

This room can be set up for Math practical tests. It houses resources for Mathematics. The use of manipulatives in our teaching can help students to grasp and understand Math concepts easily. They can also see Math in practice and real life when they work with concrete materials instead of just working with abstract numbers.

### MEDIA RESOURCE LIBRARY

We want to build a conducive environment so that our students can enjoy coming to the library and be comfortable when they are reading. We are building our stock of books. So far, most books are for the younger children and in time to come, there will be more for older children.

We have a full-time librarian to look after the library.


Every week, as part of English lessons, our students come to the library. Students can borrow up to 4 books for 2 weeks and they use their EZlink cards to sign out for the books. There is a bookdrop at the entrance of the library for students to return the books.

We welcome parents to donate books to the library or class library so that our children can have access to a wide variety of books.

  

There is a stage equipped with a light and sound system. This is like a mini theatre. We can have Orators@Waterway and Speech and Drama lessons here where students can learn to present and act confidently in the presence of an audience.


### PAL ROOMS 1 & 2

We have 2 PAL rooms. PAL stands for “Programme for Active Learning” and is for P1 and P2 students. We have PAL to expose students to Sports and Outdoor Education, and Performing and Visual Arts so that students can learn actively beyond classroom.

  

We want children to learn through fun. PAL lessons are conducted for 2 hours weekly. The PAL rooms have mirrors and children learn dance and movement in these rooms.


### SCIENCE ROOMS

The Science Rooms are used for Science lessons. We can set up equipment for activity-based lessons to maximise learning during curriculum time.

### TEACHING LAB & OBSERVATION ROOM

The Teaching Lab and Observation Room are used for teachers to share and observe one another’s teaching. Lessons are conducted in the teaching lab and those in the observation room will observe the lesson through a one-way mirror without distracting the students in the Teaching Lab.

  

Such a set-up allows teachers to observe and learn from more experienced teachers. They can learn how to teach new topics more effectively and pick up tips on classroom management.

  

The Observation Room is currently used for ICT lessons and students use laptops from mobile carts with wireless access and high speed LAN points. For P1, we have 2 periods of ICT within the timetable. During the ICT lessons, students learn to independently operate the basic functions of a laptop, navigate the internet environment, access online learning management systems and pick up other skills such as word processing and e-mail. They also learn about Cyberwellness so that they know how to keep themselves safe online.
