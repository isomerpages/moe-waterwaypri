## Academic

### CLASSROOMS

This is a typical classroom. We set up a conducive learning environment in the classroom. Children are seated in groups to facilitate group work.

  

They also come to the front to sit down for some lessons. Children’s work is displayed in the classroom. Class rules are written clearly. There are reading corners so that children can be encouraged to read on their own and with others.



### LEARNING BEHAVIOUR SUPPORT ROOM (LBS)

These rooms are used when we do small group teaching. We have allied educators to teach small groups of students who need more support with their learning. For example, some students with dyslexia might have difficulties with reading while others might have difficulties following lessons in a normal classroom setting.


### MATHEMATICS ROOM

This room can be set up for Math practical tests. It houses resources for Mathematics. The use of manipulatives in our teaching can help students to grasp and understand Math concepts easily. They can also see Math in practice and real life when they work with concrete materials instead of just working with abstract numbers.

### MEDIA RESOURCE LIBRARY

The library is a conducive environment for our students to read comfortably. A weekly reading time is stipulated during the English lessons for our students. Each student may borrow up to 4 books for 2 weeks using their student card (EZlink cards). Students may return their books at the bookdrop at the entrance of the Library.

We have a full-time librarian to look after the library.

We welcome parents to donate books to the library or class library so that our children can have access to a wide variety of books.
 

A stage equipped with light and sound system provides a mini theatre experience for Orators@Waterway and Speeach and Drama lessons and learning. This provides the space for our students to express themselves confidently in the presence of an audience. 


### PAL ROOMS 1 & 2

The P1 and P2 students have their Programmes for Active Learning (PAL) modules conducted in these rooms.

The 2 PAL rooms are airconditioned, soundproof and  equipped with light and sound system so that it is able to function as a mini stage. 

### SCIENCE ROOMS

The Science Rooms are used for Science lessons. We can set up equipment for activity-based lessons to maximise learning during curriculum time.

### TEACHING LAB & OBSERVATION ROOM

The Teaching Lab and Observation Room are used for teachers to share and observe one another’s teaching. Lessons are conducted in the teaching lab and those in the observation room will observe the lesson through a one-way mirror without distracting the students in the Teaching Lab.

  

Such a set-up allows teachers to observe and learn from more experienced teachers. They can learn how to teach new topics more effectively and pick up tips on classroom management.
