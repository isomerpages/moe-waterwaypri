<p>The lighthouse, an icon of Waterway Primary School, represents a student
from Waterway Primary School who has ideas. We want to equip our students
with the required mindset, thinking tools, skills, and provide a conducive
culture and environment for them to turn their ideas into reality through
making.</p>
<p>We hope for our students to be life-long learners who are critical, adaptive
and inventive thinkers, and are able to identify, collaborate and solve
any problems/challenges they might face in their future.&nbsp;</p>
