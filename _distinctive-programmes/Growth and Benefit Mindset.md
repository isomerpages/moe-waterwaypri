## Growth and Benefit Mindset

#### Growth Mindset

A Growth Mindset refers to the belief that a person’s abilities and intelligence can be developed through
dedication and hard work. According to Dr. Carol Dweck – the professor of psychology who coined the
term and studied the scientific effects of a Growth Mindset for thirty over years. While someone with a
fixed mindset believes in innate strengths, someone with a growth mindset believes that the brain is
malleable and hence effort and experience can lead to higher achievement outcomes. Students who
believe that they can learn more and can become smarter through hard work and perseverance indeed
learn more, learn faster and learn more thoroughly. Such students perceive challenges and mistakes as
opportunities to improve their learning and abilities. As such, they have a love for learning and the
resilience necessary for great accomplishments.

  

The school values of **Self-discipline** and **Integrity** underpin a Growth Mindset.

  

The growth mindset is imbued in students through explicit teaching during Orators lessons as well as
through integration in subjects across the curriculum.

##### P1 Growth Mindset Activity Book

_In 2020, a series of growth mindset lessons was rolled out to our Primary 1 students. An activity book was specially designed by our teachers for this purpose. The topics covered include what a growth mindset is, positive self-talk, dealing with challenges and learning from mistakes._

_To sustain and establish a culture of growth mindset, students read a prescribed book on growth mindset or graciousness every fortnight and answer some questions in their reflection journals. Through this programme, we hope that our students will improve in their language skills and build a habit of introspection._

### Benefit Mindset


A Benefit Mindset takes the Growth Mindset one step further. Rather than learning and growing just for the sake of individual gain, a person with a Benefit Mindset believes that by growing to be his best, he can best apply his strengths to benefit the world around him. He aspires to discover his strengths so that he can meaningfully contribute to causes greater than himself. By making meaningful and valuable contributions to the larger community, he feels happy, accomplished and successful. This drives him to further grow himself so that he may better benefit the world. In a nutshell, the Benefit Mindset is a purpose-driven mindset to think beyond self, to think not of just being better than others but how to be better for others.  

  

The school values of **Responsibility** and **Empathy** underpin a Benefit Mindset.

The Growth and Benefit Mindsets aim to prepare the students of Waterway Primary School, for work, for life and for the future. The mindsets are integrated into the school’s curriculum so that there is synergy in practice and application. Through the programmes, our students learn to connect the dots between individual well-being and collective betterment. As they strategise to overcome challenges, reflect on their own mistakes, find meaning and purpose in things they learn and do, and think of effective ways to relates to others around them, Waterway Primary students will grow to be lifelong learners and gracious citizens.
