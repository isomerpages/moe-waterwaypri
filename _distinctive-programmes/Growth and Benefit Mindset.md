<h2>Growth and Benefit Mindset</h2>
<h4>Growth Mindset</h4>
<p>A Growth Mindset refers to the belief that a person’s abilities and intelligence
can be developed through dedication and hard work. According to Dr. Carol
Dweck – the professor of psychology who coined the term and studied the
scientific effects of a Growth Mindset for thirty over years. While someone
with a fixed mindset believes in innate strengths, someone with a growth
mindset believes that the brain is malleable and hence effort and experience
can lead to higher achievement outcomes. Students who believe that they
can learn more and can become smarter through hard work and perseverance
indeed learn more, learn faster and learn more thoroughly. Such students
perceive challenges and mistakes as opportunities to improve their learning
and abilities. As such, they have a love for learning and the resilience
necessary for great accomplishments.</p>
<p>The school values of&nbsp;<strong>Self-discipline</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Integrity</strong>&nbsp;underpin
a Growth Mindset.</p>
<p>The growth mindset is imbued in students through explicit teaching during
Orators lessons as well as through integration in subjects across the curriculum.</p>

<p><em>To sustain and establish a culture of growth mindset, students read a prescribed book on growth mindset or graciousness every fortnight and answer some questions in their reflection journals. Through this programme, we hope that our students will improve in their language skills and build a habit of introspection.</em>

<h3>Benefit Mindset</h3>
<p>A Benefit Mindset takes the Growth Mindset one step further. Rather than
learning and growing just for the sake of individual gain, a person with
a Benefit Mindset believes that by growing to be his best, he can best
apply his strengths to benefit the world around him. He aspires to discover
his strengths so that he can meaningfully contribute to causes greater
than himself. By making meaningful and valuable contributions to the larger
community, he feels happy, accomplished and successful. This drives him
to further grow himself so that he may better benefit the world. In a nutshell,
the Benefit Mindset is a purpose-driven mindset to think beyond self, to
think not of just being better than others but how to be better for others.</p>

<p>The Growth and Benefit Mindsets aim to prepare the students of Waterway
Primary School, for work, for life and for the future. The mindsets are
integrated into the school’s curriculum so that there is synergy in practice
and application. Through the programmes, our students learn to connect
the dots between individual well-being and collective betterment. As they
strategise to overcome challenges, reflect on their own mistakes, find
meaning and purpose in things they learn and do, and think of effective
ways to relates to others around them, Waterway Primary students will grow
to be lifelong learners and gracious citizens.</p>
