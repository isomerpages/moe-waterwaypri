DISTINCTIVE PROGRAMMES


## Orators@Waterway
Orators@Waterway, our school’s Applied Learning Programme, is a key programme aimed at nurturing our students into gracious persons, engaging communicators and confident leaders. Recognising the need for our students to be socially and culturally competent in an increasingly globalised world, we seek to equip them with the listening, thinking and speaking skills critical for thriving in the 21st century.

Students will receive training in areas such as drama, storytelling, topical sharing, news writing, literature appreciation, persuasive speaking, debating, and interview skills – all with a view to enable our students to use the English language and their body language skilfully to communicate their ideas. Within a secure and encouraging environment, each student is progressively groomed to reach his or her personal peak of excellence.

At the lower primary level, they learn to interact with others in a positive, respectful and culturally appropriate manner; conducting themselves well, practising active listening, maintaining eye contact with their communication partners and speaking clearly.

At the middle primary level, they learn to structure their presentations, to effectively engage their audience, and to speak with poise and confidence as they present to the crowds

At the upper primary level, they are given the platform to showcase good speaking and presentation skills when they stand in front of the camera to share interesting Science facts as part of their broadcasting project. They brainstorm, plan, write their own script, shoot footage and edit their video from pre to post production.

Upper primary students who display strong verbal talent will have the opportunity to further develop their oral competencies and critical thinking skills through participating in the Debate Enrichment Programme. During the programme, students learn to frame their thoughts using clear deductive reasoning, put forth persuasive arguments and rebut their opponents’ arguments. In the process, they strengthen their communication, collaboration, and information skills and become more self-directed learners.
 
This year, for the first time, our school sent a team of students to participate in the Wits and Words Inter-school Debate Championship 2023. The team comprised Cheong Tristan (6A), Balaquiot Caitlin Penticostes (6B), Aarav Manish Gidwani (6C), Asher Lee Le Sheng (6E) and Saesha Nish Ramkhelawon (6E). After two preliminary rounds and a quarterfinal round, the team was placed amongst the top 8 in Division 2. Asher Lee Le Sheng (6E) was also awarded the Good Speaker Award for his outstanding performance.
