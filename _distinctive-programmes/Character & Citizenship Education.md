<p><strong>Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) and National Education / Social Studies (NE/SS) Department</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>The Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) aims to develop in our students: &nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Our CCE programmes are anchored on our School Values of Responsibility,
Integrity, Self-discipline and Empathy (RISE), Social Emotional Competencies
and the 3 Big Ideas of CCE, <em>Identity, Relationships </em>and<em> Choices</em>.
We aim to develop our students to be gracious citizens – confident, well
mannered and kind.</p>
<p>The CCE programmes adopt a “Head-Heart- Hands” approach.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Head</strong>&nbsp;– Through the various curricula - CCE (Form
Teachers Guidance Period), CCE (Mother Tongue Languages), Social Studies
and Growth and Benefit Mindset Modular CCA , students learn values, social
competencies and National Education explicitly. These curricula help students
to grow in knowledge, develop skills and learn values through examining
issues that are of concern to Singapore and the world in which we live
in. In-class opportunities are provided for students to apply the core
values and social emotional competencies.</p>
<p><strong>Heart</strong>&nbsp;–We win our students’ hearts over through
sharing and bonding activities during festive celebrations, National Education
Commemorative events, such as Total Defence Day, International Friendship
Day, Racial Harmony Day and National Day, to inspire hope and instill pride.
We give recognition to students who can be role models to other students
to help them feel good about themselves and for others to learn from and
aspire to be. We build a school culture with a strong focus on care and
inclusivity where every teacher, regardless of what subjects they teach,
are all CCE teachers. Our common language is premised on the Growth and
Benefit Mindset. Our teachers prepare Good Morning School (GMS) presentations,
to expose our students to topics and issues outside of the curriculum,
broaden our students’ horizons and help them to make connections of their
learning across the total curriculum.</p>
<p><strong>Hands</strong>&nbsp;–Students practise values through their participation
in Co-curricular Activities (CCA), Values-in- Action (VIA) activities and
National Education events. Student participation in the planning and implementation
of some aspects of CCE, such as in VIA projects, gives them the space to
be heard, and to play an active role in what and how they learn, hence
providing opportunities for them to develop agency or self-directedness,
responsibility and ownership of their learning.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Partnership with parents</strong>
<br>Parents are the first care-givers in developing good character of their
children. The development of character and citizenship dispositions in
our students is influenced by what happens in school, in the family and
in the wider community. There is active partnership between school and
home when what is taught and learnt in school is reinforced at home. “Family
Time” in the CCE (FTGP) and CCE (MTL) lessons provide suggestions for activities
which allow parents to bond with their children and support their children’s
development. These activities, such as “Family Chat Time!” and “Family
Activities” also enable parents to partner with schools in this meaningful
journey of supporting your child/ward in his/her learning of social-emotional
competencies and values.</p>
