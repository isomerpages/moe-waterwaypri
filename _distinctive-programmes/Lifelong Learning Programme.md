<p>The <strong>Empowering Voices, Cultivating Leaders (EVoCL)</strong> programme
is a 6-year Learning for Life Programme. In accordance with the objectives
of the Student Leadership Development Committee, this initiative strives
to imbue students with critical thinking and oratorical skills, emphasising
the interconnectedness of thought and language as foundational elements
in shaping leadership competencies.</p>

<p>In the journey towards Thought Leadership, situated at the pinnacle of
the Student Leadership Framework, EVoCL adopts a spiral approach, progressively
guiding students through various levels of leadership development. The
process begins at primary 1 with a focus on self-leadership, deepening
at primary 2 where peer leadership is introduced. The programme continues
to emphasise on peer leadership at primary 3, followed by the introduction
of team leadership at primary 4. As students engage in more advanced learning
experiences focused on team leadership at primary 5, they concurrently
encounter opportunities to cultivate thought leadership. This emphasis
on thought leadership is further developed in primary 6.</p>
<p>The table below shows the various modules students in Waterway learn through
the EvoCL programme in the span of 6 years.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Throughout each level, EVoCL revisits and enhances previous learning
experiences, ensuring a continuous and integrated progression towards thought
leadership. The ultimate goal is to empower students not only to lead within
the school community but also to extend their influence on the broader
community, exemplifying the school's motto: "To Learn, To Lead, To Serve."
Through consistent and exemplary actions, students will inspire and benefit
both the learning community at Waterway Primary School and the wider community,
showcasing the transformative impact of their leadership.</p>
