## Mathematics


**Aim: Confident and Creative Problem Solving**

  

We emphasise the building of strong foundations as mathematics learning is largely hierarchical in nature. Higher concepts and skills are built upon foundational ones. There is no limit to creative problem solving and acquiring mathematics process skills helps students to develop cognitive structures for real-world current and future science, economics and technological challenges. Through heuristics skills such as model drawing, students are taught to present and articulate problems. Heuristics and algorithms promote in students the mental discipline to deploy adaptable and systematic strategies.

  

Concepts, use and estimation of heights, lengths, distances, time, weights and quantities promote application of mathematics as part of daily living. At the lower primary levels, as students are at the concrete operational stage of cognitive development, mathematics manipulatives are used widely in the classroom to aid students in understanding abstract concepts and enhance their learning.
