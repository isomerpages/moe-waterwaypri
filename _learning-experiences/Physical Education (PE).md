<p><strong>Introduction:</strong> 
<br>The PE department seeks to develop physically competent and confident
individuals. Through our curriculum and meaningful learning experiences,
we aim to help students realise the importance of safe participation in
physical activities, and the joy of maintaining an active and healthy lifestyle.
<br>
<br><strong>Department Goals:</strong> 
<br>Our PE education focuses on three learning areas, namely, Physical Activity,
Outdoor Education, and Physical Health and Safety.&nbsp; With a strong
emphasis in, about, and through movement, students are offered innumerable
opportunities to participate in physical activities and cooperate with
their peers to reinforce learning. In addition, our lessons are crafted
with purposeful assessment and pedagogy in hope to help students develop
the essential competencies to succeed in our fast-changing world.</p>

<p><strong>Physical Education Curriculum Framework</strong>

Dance, Games and Sports, Gymnastics, and Swimming. Through these content
areas, students are taught fundamental movement skills, movement concepts,
along with the transference of these skills and concepts across the various
content areas.</p>

to build student’s confidence, help them identify potential outdoor hazards,
and develop appreciation for flora and fauna.</p>
