<br>Student Management at Waterway Primary School is committed to fostering
a <strong>Caring </strong>and <strong>Enabling </strong>environment where
every student feels <strong>Safe</strong>, <strong>Respected</strong>, and <strong>Valued</strong>.</p>
<p>We believe that when students feel Safe, they are more motivated to give
their best in school. A sense of safety reduces the likelihood of misbehavior
and encourages students to approach life and its challenges with our RISE
values, resilience and a Growth Mindset.</p>
<p>A key aspect of creating this sense of safety is ensuring that students
feel Respected by their teachers. Respect begins with teachers role-modeling
respectful behavior towards students. This principle is embodied in our
use of Restorative Practices (RP) to address discipline cases and our emphasis
on building strong Teacher-Student Relationships (TSR).</p>
<p>When students feel both Safe and Respected, they develop a strong sense
of belonging and purpose within the school community. This sense of connection
inspires them to contribute positively to the lives of others. Acts of
kindness and responsibility are celebrated through our "Caught Doing Right"
(CDR) program, which recognizes and commends students at various levels
based on the impact of their good deeds. This recognition reinforces their
sense of being Valued in the school.</p>
<p>In essence, our Student Management approach is rooted in positive discipline,
empowering teachers to cultivate a <strong>Caring </strong>and <strong>Enabling </strong>environment
where every student feels Safe, <strong>Respected</strong>, and <strong>Valued</strong>.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Key Programmes</strong>:
<br><u>Peer Support Leaders (PSL) Programme</u> 
<br>At the P4 level, students will be identified by their teachers to go through
training to be Peer Support Leaders (PSLs). PSLs are student leaders who
play the important role of championing PSR in our school. They participate
in campaigns to promote <em>Mental Wellbeing</em>, <em>Friendship</em>, <em>Kindness</em> and
a <em>Bully-free school environment</em>. PSLs are also given platforms
to implement PSR initiatives.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Lighthouse Club</u> (in collaboration with CCE Department)</p>
<p>The Lighthouse Club, an after-school programme, is established in 2024
to support students from disadvantaged backgrounds. The club aims to strengthen
its members’ self-identity and develop their sense of belonging to Waterway
Primary.</p>
<p>Members of the club engage in fun and meaningful activities such as gardening,
sports and workshops on social emotional learning. The diverse range of
programmes also aim to expose students to varied experiences, develop their
physical &amp; mental wellbeing and build their confidence.</p>
