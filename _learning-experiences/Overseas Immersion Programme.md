<p><strong>Developing 21st Century Competencies through Waterway Primary School’s &nbsp;Overseas Immersion Programme</strong>
<br>
<br>Waterway Primary School believes in evolving our school learning experiences
to meet the demands of a rapidly changing world, to help our students learn
and apply their learning in authentic contexts. The Overseas Immersion
Programme at Waterway supports the school’s vision to develop lifelong
learners and gracious citizens by fostering cultural understanding and
ASEAN awareness, nurturing eco-sustainability and providing the platform
to exchange knowledge on Maker &nbsp;Education with foreign counterparts.</p>
<p>In 2024, our Primary 5 students will be travelling to Penang from 14 to
16 May, visiting cultural sites, museums and farms.
<br>
<br>As part of the school immersion experience, we will be partnering Kuang
Hua Primary School, Sungai Limeng at Penang. Our students will engage with
their overseas peers via an online interaction session in April before
the actual school visit in May. The school exchange will center around
Maker Education, which both schools share keen interest in, cultural immersion
and eco-sustainability.</p>
<p><strong>Through the Overseas Immersion Programme, Waterway Primary School aims to:</strong>
</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To deepen students’ understanding
of cultural diversity :</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The primary objective of overseas
immersion programs is to deepen students' understanding of different cultures.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through firsthand experiences in
foreign environments, students develop empathy, cultural sensitivity, and
cross-cultural communication skills.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By engaging with diverse communities,
students learn to appreciate the richness of global diversity and navigate
cultural differences with respect and openness.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To promote ASEAN Awareness among
students:</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As part of the social studies curriculum,
understanding the importance of regional cooperation is paramount.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Overseas immersion programs offer
students the opportunity to explore the significance of ASEAN, the Association
of Southeast Asian Nations, in promoting economic, political, and socio-cultural
integration among its member states.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To help students have a deeper appreciation
of regional collaboration and the interconnectedness of ASEAN nations.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To provide a platform for the application
of learning – Maker Education and Eco-Sustainability:</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maker Education at Waterway supports
the nation’s and school’s drive to develop adaptive, inventive and critical
thinking skills In students, and in doing so prepares them for the future
of learning.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fostering eco-sustainability has
become a pressing concern and the overseas immersion programme provide
students with opportunities to learn more about environmental conservation
efforts and sustainable practices.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To support the development of 21st
Century Competencies in students in the following ways:</p>
<p>a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Critical Thinking and Problem-Solving</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The overseas immersion will challenge
students to take care of themselves and be more independent.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students will need to think critically
and work collaboratively to solve problems in unfamiliar contexts. Students
develop resilience, adaptability, and innovative thinking skills.</p>
<p>b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Communication and Collaboration:</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Engaging with counterparts in the
partnering school during the overseas immersion programme enhances students'
communication and collaboration skills. By interacting with individuals
from different cultural backgrounds, students learn to communicate effectively,
negotiate differences, and work collaboratively towards common goals. These
interpersonal skills are invaluable in an interconnected world where global
collaboration is increasingly essential.</p>
<p>&nbsp;c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cultural Competence:</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Immersion in foreign cultures through
visits to cultural sites and museums, fosters cultural competence, enabling
students to interact respectfully and empathetically with individuals from
diverse backgrounds.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By understanding and appreciating
cultural differences, students develop a global mindset and the ability
to thrive in multicultural environments.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cultural competence is a foundational
competency for global citizenship and effective cross-cultural collaboration
in the 21st century.</p>
<p>d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Environmental Literacy:</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The programme contributes to our
students' environmental literacy.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through visits to farms, students
develop a greater understanding about conservation efforts by commercial
companies.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Environmental literacy is essential
for informed decision-making and sustainable living.</p>
<p>The Overseas Immersion Programme at Waterway will extend to include more
students from different levels and to different countries over the next
few years. The programme will serve as a transformative culmination of
Maker Education, deepening students' cultural understanding, promoting
ASEAN awareness, and nurturing eco-sustainability.</p>
