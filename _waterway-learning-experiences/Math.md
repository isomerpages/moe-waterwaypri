<p><strong><u>Department Vision</u></strong>
</p>
<p>To develop confident and competent Mathematics problem solvers.</p>
<p><strong><u>Curriculum</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The curriculum of Mathematics in Waterway Primary School follows the Primary
Mathematics Syllabus of MOE, Singapore.</p>
<p>We aim to nurture our students to:</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Acquire mathematical concepts and
skills for everyday use and continuous learning in Mathematics.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Develop thinking, reasoning, communication,
application and metacognitive skills through a mathematical approach to
problem solving; and</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Build confidence and foster interest
in mathematics.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><u>Teaching and Learning</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The teaching framework of our department takes the approach of engaging,
exploring and enriching students’ learning of Mathematics.</p>
<p>These are some of our programmes at Waterway Primary School.</p>

<p><em>Joy of Learning</em>
</p>
<p>Fostering interest and confidence in Mathematics stems from the love of
learning and when they are able to make connections with their everyday
experiences. We make use of CPA (Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract) approach
to bring learning alive.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Various recess activities are lined up for students from P1 to P6. Not
only does it bring fun, it also enables students to apply their learning
in different contexts.</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Differentiated Learning</em>
</p>
<p>Technology is used to enhance the learning experiences of students. Flipped
learning is used in some lessons to encourage students’ agency and to pique
their curiosity. Their learning at home is consolidated in class with various
products made collaboratively with their peers to exhibit their learning.</p>
<p><em>Extending their learning</em>
</p>
<p>To extend the learning of students who have a good foundation in mathematics,
a small group of students are selected to attend the E2K (Excellence 2000)
program for Mathematics. It challenges the thought processes of the students
and make them come up with logical and creative solutions.</p>
<p>Students are also able to sign up for STEM enrichment programs after school.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><u>Assessment</u></strong>
<br>The following are various modes of assessments in Waterway Primary School.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bite-sized Topical Reviews</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Performance Tasks</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Portfolio Activities (P1 and P2)</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Patchwork assessment</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End-of-Year Examination</p>
<p>These assessments not only provide feedback on students’ learning, but
also provide us with information on their learning gaps so that suitable
intervention can be put in place to bridge this gap in a timely manner.&nbsp;</p>
