<p><strong>Introduction</strong>:
<br>The Music department believes that every child possesses innate musical
qualities to be harnessed and developed. These aural and expressive abilities
empower our students to appreciate and participate in musical experiences
that enhance and enrich themselves and about the world. Our programmes
are crafted to provide our students with experiences to acquire and apply
musical skills, knowledge and understanding through listening, creating
and performing. It is an enjoyment and appreciation for all, and talent
and interest development for some.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;Department/Committee Goals and how they help achieve 21 CC </strong>(include
department/committee/CPDD framework where applicable):
<br>We aim to develop in our students an awareness of and appreciation of
music locally and globally by engaging with songs. They learn musical elements
and concepts through the 3Es â€“ Experience, Explore and Experiment. These
active hands-on experiences hone their musical communication skills, creativity,
critical thinking and collaboration among peers.

<p>&nbsp;<strong>Curriculum and/or Programmes</strong>:
<br>Music @ Waterway Primary begins with singing and movement in the earlier
years to picking up instrument-playing skills on the recorder, ukulele
and xylophone, as well as creating music. Students who are passionate and
have keen interest or talented in Music will be provided with other platforms
for development such as internal (S!NG@WAP) / external music competitions
or performances (Singapore Youth Festival).</p>
<p>Our annual WAP Centrestage provides a platform for our talented budding
musicians/ artistes to showcase their performance in terms of singing,
dancing and instrumental playing. These allows the whole school to share
and celebrate the music achievements together as a big community.&nbsp;

<p>We empower our students to make well-informed music choices through the
activities in our programmes (eg: P2 Performing Arts (PA) CCA Module, Project
Local Composers) so that they can become active contributors through music
as well.</p>
