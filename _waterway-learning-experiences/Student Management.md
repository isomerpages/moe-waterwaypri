<p>The Student Management (SM) Committee aims to create a safe, caring and
enabling school environment so that WAP students will be able to think
positively, feel supported and embrace their future with optimism. The
committee focuses on promoting Positive Discipline, Student Wellbeing and
Peer Support Relationships (PSR).&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Department Goals and how they help achieve 21 CC</strong>:</p>

<p>We believe in taking a positive and proactive approach to promote discipline
and wellbeing. Through the CCE curriculum, classroom lessons and school
experiences, we teach and demonstrate positive values to our students and
provide students with opportunities to establish strong <strong><em>PSR</em></strong>.</p>
<p>We adopt the <strong><em>Restorative Practice</em></strong> approach towards
addressing inappropriate behaviour. Teachers will guide students to reflect
on their actions and to restore the relationships that they have damaged.
We believe in guiding our students to take ownership of their mistakes
and we will empower them correct their wrongdoings.

<p><strong>Developing 21CC</strong> 
<br>Through our programmes, students will develop <strong><em>Social-Emotional Competencies</em></strong> -
Self-Awareness, Self-Management, Relationship Management, Responsible Decision-Making
and Social Awareness.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Key Programmes</strong>:
<br><u>Peer Support Leaders (PSL) Programme</u> 
<br>At the P4 level, students will be identified by their teachers to go through
training to be Peer Support Leaders (PSLs). PSLs are student leaders who
play the important role of championing PSR in our school. They participate
in campaigns to promote <em>Mental Wellbeing</em>, <em>Friendship</em>, <em>Kindness</em> and
a <em>Bully-free school environment</em>. PSLs are also given platforms
to implement PSR initiatives.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Lighthouse Club</u> (in collaboration with CCE Department)</p>
<p>The Lighthouse Club, an after-school programme, is established in 2024
to support students from disadvantaged backgrounds. The club aims to strengthen
its membersâ€™ self-identity and develop their sense of belonging to Waterway
Primary.</p>
<p>Members of the club engage in fun and meaningful activities such as gardening,
sports and workshops on social emotional learning. The diverse range of
programmes also aim to expose students to varied experiences, develop their
physical &amp; mental wellbeing and build their confidence.</p>
