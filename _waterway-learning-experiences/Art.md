<p><strong>Introduction</strong>:
<br>Art holds great importance in the society. It fosters creativity, is a
form of expression and serves as a valuable historical record. In Waterway
Primary School, we want our students to enjoy Art, be able to communicate
visually and make meaning through connecting with culture and society.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Department/Committee Goals and how they help achieve 21 CC</strong>
<br>The objectives of the syllabus are achieved through the Primary Art Syllabus
Framework in <u>Figure 1.</u>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 1: Primary Art Syllabus Framework</p>
<p>The three key learning domains in the framework (<strong>See, Express and Appreciate</strong>)
guides us in crafting the goals and objectives we want our students to
achieve by the end of each academic year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Curriculum and/or Programmes</strong>:
<br>At Waterway Primary School, we introduce our students to a variety of
art forms and mediums (refer to <u>Table 1</u>) over the course of six years.
To help students develop the 21<sup>st</sup> Century Competencies, we encourage
exploration and creative expression, equip them with the necessary skills,
craft student-centric art tasks, provide opportunities for them to collaborate
in group settings and guide them in Art discussion to help them develop
visual literacy and appreciation for Art. Contemporary issues like fast
fashion and food waste are incorporated into lessons to help students develop
global awareness. We want to create rich learning experiences for our students
that will enable them to be active artists and informed audiences.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Showcase of Artworks</p>
<p>At the start of every academic year, all students will visit the Learning
Gallery in school to view the artworks done by their schoolmates and engage
in meaningful conversation facilitated by the art teachers. The Learning
Gallery is an alternative platform for students to communicate and express
their views to a wider audience.</p>
<p>Besides the Learning Gallery, selected artworks done by students will
also be displayed in the Principal's office and school compound. &nbsp;</p>
