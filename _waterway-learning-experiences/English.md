<p>The teachers of the English Department are committed to our vision, which
is the strengthening of our students' linguistic aptitude and the empowerment
of individuals to be committed and lifelong learners of the language.</p>

<p>At the core of the pedagogical framework resides the STELLAR programme—
designed to instil a fervour for language and literature. Epitomizing our
dedication is the Literature Programme, finely tailored for Primary 4 and
5 students. This initiative serves as a testament to the commitment to
cultivating an ardour for the written word while nurturing critical thinking
skills from an early developmental stage.</p>
<p></p>
<p>For students aspiring to elevate their intellectual acumen, the department
takes pride in presenting two exclusive programmes—Reading Circles and
Debate, for Primary 5 and 6 students. Tailored for selected students, these
initiatives foster collaborative discussions and refine the art of persuasive
communication and critical reasoning.</p>

<p>To celebrate students’ effort in writing, we also hold Writers' Fest -
an event meticulously crafted to celebrate students’ finest written works.
This literary extravaganza is a testament to the creative prowess of our
students. It provides a platform for budding writers to showcase their
talents, offering a diverse array of narratives and essays. What makes
this occasion truly special is the interactive element—the opportunity
for peers to engage in the enriching experience of reading and offering
feedback on their classmates' writings. The fest becomes a dynamic forum
where constructive criticism mingles with words of encouragement and motivation,
creating a supportive environment that inspires every participant to hone
their skills and reach new heights in their literary endeavours. It is
more than an event; it is a celebration of creativity, fostering a community
that recognizes and nurtures the burgeoning talents within our student
body.</p>

<p>In addition to our academic endeavours, the English Department is proud
to offer a lively array of recess activities designed to infuse a sense
of joy and enthusiasm for language among our students. These engaging sessions
serve as a delightful interlude, providing students with the opportunity
to participate in English activities and games during their recess breaks.
From word games that spark creativity to collaborative storytelling sessions
that foster teamwork, these activities contribute not only to linguistic
development but also to the overall enjoyment of language learning. By
seamlessly blending fun and education, our recess activities exemplify
our commitment to making the English language an exciting and integral
part of every student's daily experience. It is not just about learning;
it is about creating lasting memories and a genuine love for the beauty
of language.</p>

<p>We are also excited in anticipation of our milestone in 2024, with the
launch of our literacy programme for lower primary students to establish
a sturdy foundation in language skills, ensuring each student is equipped
with the requisite tools for confident and efficacious communication.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Guiding this journey are our esteemed teachers, a cohort of dedicated
and experienced professionals. Their commitment to excellence and passion
for fostering language proficiency and critical thinking are the cornerstones
of our department's strength. Together, we can unlock the transformative
potential of words, paving the way for each student to discover the joy
of expression and the enchantment of storytelling.</p>
