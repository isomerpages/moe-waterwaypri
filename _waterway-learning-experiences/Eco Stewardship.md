<p><strong>Theme &amp; Approach</strong> 
<br>The mission will be achieved through awareness building, providing platforms
for advocacy and authentic learning experiences.</p>
<p>Eco Stewardship @ WAPS’ theme – <em>Protecting Waterways, Celebrating Biodiversity</em> is
inspired by Punggol Town’s unique agricultural heritage and Waterfront
Eco-Town identity. Building on our town’s heritage and identity, our programme
has a unique focus on water and biodiversity conservation. Through classroom
lessons, school activities and outdoor learning experiences, our students
will learn and be given opportunities to,
<br>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Conserve and protect water resources
<br>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Conserve and promote biodiversity</p>
<p>The programme also on the school’s Growth &amp; Benefit Mindset (GBM)
programme. It provides platforms for students to develop and practice applying
the growth and benefit mindset that they have acquired through GBM lessons.</p>
<p>Besides engaging students in school, the programme seeks to involve all
its stakeholders (i.e. staff, parents and community partners) in developing
and enhancing the 4Cs:
<br>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>C</strong>urriculum &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
- Infuse lessons on sustainability into current school curriculum
<br>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>C</strong>ampus&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
- Enhance campus with sustainability features
<br>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>C</strong>ulture &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
- Promote and encourage sustainable habits and practices
<br>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>C</strong>ommunity &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
- Leverage community partners to provide students with authentic&nbsp;
learning partnership opportunities
