<p><strong>Introduction</strong>
</p>
<p>At Waterway Primary School, our Mother Tongue Language (MTL) Department
aims to cultivate a vibrant and inclusive environment where every student
embraces and excels in their mother tongue.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>MTL Department Key Goals</strong>
</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To provide a nurturing and engaging platform
for students to develop proficiency in their mother tongue, empowering
them with the language skills necessary for confident expression and collaboration.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To cultivate a positive attitude towards learning,
fostering qualities of diligence curiosity and joy in acquiring knowledge.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To instill a sense of pride and connection
to the cultural roots in all students.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Through age-appropriate pedagogical approaches, collaborative partnership
with stakeholders, and continuous professional development for our teachers,
we strive to create an atmosphere where students not only learn their mother
tongue but also understand its cultural context. We believe that the mastery
of one's mother tongue forms the basis for effective communication and
collaboration, promoting an attitude of openness and respect for linguistic
diversity, ready to thrive in a globalized society.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>MTL Department Vision</strong>
</p>
<p>Empowering linguistic mastery and fostering cultural respect for students
to thrive as effective communicators and collaborators in our interconnected
world.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>MTL Department Mission</strong>
</p>
<p>Our department mission is to nurture every student through the mastery
of their mother tongue language, excel in communication and collaboration,
while fostering a deep respect for the cultural diversity of our interconnected
world.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>MTL Department Programmes</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mother Tongue Language Fortnight and Cultural Camp/ Experience</strong>
</p>
<p>In Waterway Primary, we create an immersive environment for the learning
of MTL and to provide platforms for students to actively learn MTL and
the associated culture to experience MTL as ‘a living language’. A wide
range of class-based, level-based and recess activities related to Chinese,
Malay, Tamil languages and culture will be conducted. The Cultural Camp/
Experience provides an immersive environment for students to learn and
use their mother tongue in a more in-depth manner, and to appreciate their
respective cultures through hands-on tasks such as craft work, learning
journey and/ or performances.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cultural Performance Exposure Scheme (CPES)</strong>
</p>
<p>An initiative by the Committee to Promote Chinese Language Learning (CPCLL),
the Cultural Performance Exposure Scheme (CPES) is an MOE initiative that
aims to aims to expose students to Chinese language-related cultural performances
by local and foreign performing arts groups. Primary 3 students can look
forward to a theatrical experience on Chinese language related performances.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mother Tongue Language Reading Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>The MTL Reading Programme aims to instil the passion for reading mother
tongue language books that paves the way in the learning of the Language.
We hope that our students will be motivated over the years in reading MTL
books, starting with igniting the interest in them at the lower primary
level. This new initiative started with the engagement of Parent volunteers
to conduct story telling for our Primary 2 student in Chinese language
during curriculum time last year. We will be extending the programme to
all Primary 1 student this year.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Malay Language - Rakan Bahasa (Friends of the language)</strong>
</p>
<p><em>Rakan Bahasa</em> is an initiative by the Malay Language Council, Singapore
(MLCS) to encourage students who excel in the Malay language to spread
the love of the language to their peers, friends and families. As <em>Rakan Bahasa</em>,
the students will be given the opportunity to attend various workshops
and training sessions conducted by the Duta Bahasa (Language Ambassador),
fulfilling roles as reporters, guides or greeters. Students may also assist
in facilitating Duta Bahasa talks or in organising Malay-based events for
their peers, with support from the teachers.</p>

<p><strong>Parent Involvement</strong>
</p>
<p>The MTL Reading Programme – Story Telling for the lower primary, was anchored
by our parent volunteers. This was piloted in 2023 with a small group of
parent volunteers for the Chinese language Story Telling sessions. Moving
forward, we would like to extend the Story Telling sessions to include
the Malay and Tamil languages. We would like to seek partnership and collaboration
with parents who are able to render their service to the school for this
programme, to tell stories in the respective Mother Tongue languages to
the lower primary students.</p>
