<p>&gt;LEARNING EXPERIENCES</p>
<h2>Our Students, Our Pride - Students' Channel</h2>
<p>At Waterway Primary School, we want to develop in every child the passion,
the skills and the aptitude for learning so that they will be self-directed
to learn, know how to learn and be always ready to acquire new knowledge
and skills. We achieve this through a spectrum of customised distinctive
programmes that complements classroom teaching and learning.</p>
<p>As part of our students' development, we also want to see them gain self-fulfilment
and self-actualization by applying the skills, knowledge, attitude and
mindsets we have imbued in them to areas that they are passionate about.
To achieve this, Waterway Primary School provides different platforms for
students to create artefacts that leave an imprint in the sands of time.
This process gives the students pride and help build intrinsic motivation
to pursue lifelong joy in their learning.</p>
<p><strong>Students' Channel@Waterway</strong>&nbsp;is a showcase of our
students as self-regulated learners through their creation of artefacts
that demonstrate their growth and development in our school.</p>
<p><strong>Students' Channel@Waterway</strong>&nbsp;is entirely the creation
and works of our students.</p>
<h3>WAPS Art Challenge 2020 (During Circuit Breaker)</h3>
<p>Art Challenge 2020 was initiated for our students to express and show
their art talent during the Circuit Breaker. The Art Challenge was also
to encourage the students to express their emotions and feelings through
art making. The students created two-dimensional art, three-dimensional
art and even digital art.</p>
<h3>Videos by Self-Directed Learners</h3>
<p>The collection below features videos created by our students at their
own time. Applying skills learnt from Orators@Waterway, the school's Applied
Learning Programme (ALP), students explored topics close to their hearts
and unleashed their creative juices to create how-to videos, book review
videos, and short advertisements. As our students learn and grow, they
seek to benefit their audience with their creations too. We hope you will
enjoy these videos as much as our students enjoyed creating them.</p>

<h3>WAPS CoTS Challenge 2020 (During Circuit Breaker)</h3>
<p>These games were created by Waterway Primary School students during the
Circuit Breaker. To engage the students holistically, the teachers created
the CoTS challenge for students to continue learning outside of the HBL
assignments.</p>
