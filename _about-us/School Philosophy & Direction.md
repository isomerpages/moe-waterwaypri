## School Philosophy & Direction


We believe that education must prepare a child for life and work in the future. We want to develop in our students the passion, the skills and the aptitude for learning so that they will be self-directed to learn, know how to learn and be always ready to acquire new knowledge and skills. We want to build character in our students so that they will grow up with sound values, be confident persons doing what is good and right, taking care of their family, working well with others and contributing to society.

  

With our school nestled beside the beautiful Punggol waterway, students will have the unique opportunity to embark on water and environment education, learning about the rich biodiversity of Punggol. Water symbolises life and growth. It will be a reminder for our students of how Singapore overcomes the challenge of water being a limited resource. Water originates from a source and it is a reminder for our students to respect and honour the significant people in their lives while at the same time grow up rooted and strong like trees planted by the rivers, bringing forth fruit in season.

  

We believe in working in partnership with parents so that together we provide the best education possible for children to grow and develop right attitudes, beliefs, values and behaviour.
