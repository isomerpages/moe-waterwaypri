&gt; About Us 

## Principal's Message

At Waterway Primary, our  focus for 2024 is to encourage our students to take greater ownership of their learning and to develop important future-centric skillsets. To this end, I am excited to share with you that we have refreshed our Applied Learning Program (ALP) as well as our Lifelong Learning Program (LLP). 

Our ALP will be focused on fostering innovation, student agency and creativity through Maker Education and our LLP will bring together our Orators program and the Student Leadership Program to allow our students to develop to be thought leaders. Together with our focus on Growth and Benefit Mindset as well as our wide variety of programs, we will live out our Mission to provide a vibrant environment that nurtures young minds and builds upright character.

Our Vision is to develop each child to be “A lifelong learner and a gracious citizen”.  We will continue to develop in our students’ future-centric competencies and strengthen their grasp of a ‘Growth and Benefit Mindset’. We will continue to place emphasis on inculcating our school’s core values of Responsibility, Integrity, Self-discipline and Empathy (RISE) so that our students can remain anchored and learn to serve others.

I will like to take this opportunity to also thank parents for your unwavering support for Waterway Primary. Your commitment to working closely with the teachers to enrich your child’s educational journey is commendable and very much appreciated. I look forward to strengthening our spirit of close partnership in 2024.

Mr Wilbur Wong<br>
Principal
