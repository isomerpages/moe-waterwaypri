<h2>Principal's Message</h2>
<p>At Waterway Primary, our Vision is to develop each child to be “A lifelong
learner and a gracious citizen”.&nbsp; We will continue to develop in our
students’ future-centric competencies and strengthen their grasp of a ‘Growth
and Benefit Mindset’. We will continue to place emphasis on inculcating
our school’s core values of <strong>Responsibility, Integrity, Self-discipline and Empathy (RISE)</strong> so
that our students can remain anchored in values and learn to serve others.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In living out our Mission to<em> provide a vibrant environment that nurtures young minds and builds upright character, we continue to refresh our program offerings and we ensure that they remain student-centric and future-centric. Our niche programs</em> such
as our &nbsp;Applied Learning Program (ALP) on Maker Education and innovation
as well as our Lifelong Learning Program (LLP) which is focused on developing
our students to be &nbsp;thought leaders, will help our students to develop
mindsets and skillsets that will set the strong foundation for their future
learning<em>.</em>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will like to take this opportunity to also thank parents for your unwavering
support for Waterway Primary. Your commitment to working closely with the
teachers to enrich your child’s educational journey is commendable and
very much appreciated. I look forward to strengthening our spirit of close
partnership in 2025.</p>
<p>Mr Wilbur Wong
