## Principal's Message


Dear Parents/Guardians 

I would like to take this opportunity to wish you all a very Happy New Year and to also introduce myself. I am Mr Wilbur Wong and I have been appointed by the Ministry of Education to take over the principalship from Mrs Wee with effect from January 2023. 

Waterway Primary opened her doors in 2016 with 5 primary one classes and since then, we have grown from strength to strength and over the years, our family has grown and we have put in place many innovative and exciting programmes, all with the intention of providing a rich, vibrant and holistic learning experience for our students. Much of the credit for our success must go to Mrs Wee, who is the pioneering principal. Thanks to her foresight, passion and beliefs, staff and students of Waterway Primary are able to reap the fruits of her labour. As Mrs Wee moves on to the next phase of her life, we would like to thank her for her efforts and to wish her well in all her future endeavours. She will always be a treasured family member of Waterway Primary School. 

It is with great excitement that I take on the principalship of the school. Our vision, ‘**A Lifelong Learner, A Gracious Citizen**’ resonates deeply with me and remains relevant to the ever-changing world around us. Our children will grow up in a world that is complex and uncertain, where skillsets may change but they will need to develop mindsets that will take them through this ambiguity. We will continue to develop in our students’ future-centric competencies and strengthen their grasp of a ‘Growth and Benefit Mindset’. We will continue to place emphasis on inculcating our school’s core values of **Responsibility, Integrity, Self-discipline and Empathy (RISE)** so that we can remain anchored and learn to serve others. 

For us to achieve this, we will want to work closely with you, so that together we can help each child learn and grow in a safe and supportive environment. Over the course of this year, I will find more opportunities to meet up with you to share more about our approaches and programs and to seek your feedback. I look forward to meeting up with you in the year ahead.

We look forward to your continued support in 2023. Please do not hesitate to contact us or your child’s teachers if you need any advice, information, or clarification. 

Best wishes for you and your family in the new year. 

Yours sincerely 

Mr Wilbur Wong<br> 
Principal
