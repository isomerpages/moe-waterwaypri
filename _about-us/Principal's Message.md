## Principal's Message

Dear Parents and Stakeholders,

  

Waterway Primary School started in 2016. From a humble start of just 5 P1 classes then, now we have more than 1600 P1 to P6 students in the school. We have much to celebrate about in the school.

  

Our pioneer batch of PSLE students did us proud. Their performance compared very well with other schools in the neighbourhood and many of them were posted to their school of choice for their secondary education. Amongst them were students who were admitted through the Direct School Admission Exercise based on their talents and interests and students who qualified for the Integrated Programme (IP), having attained an Achievement Level (AL) score of 10 and below.

  

Over the last few years, the school attracted one of the highest number of applicants in the Punggol area under the open 2C Phase of the P1 registration exercise. We had to ballot for P1 places in the 2C phase for the last 3 years. Many parents shared with us that they chose the school despite other schools in closer proximity to their homes because they heard very good feedback about the school. Parents’ affirmation, some of which are reflected on our website as ‘Parents Say’, is an encouragement to our staff. We thank our staff for their dedication and hard work. Our staff upholds the ethos of the teaching profession in leading, caring for and inspiring our students.

  

In designing our curriculum to meet the needs of the ever-changing world, the school takes a multi-faceted approach towards education. As we live in a VUCA (volatile, uncertain, complex, ambiguous) world, it is inevitable that we are affected by the world around us. The recent pandemic and skirmishes amongst nations brought along supply chain disruptions and shortages. Technological advances and disruptive technologies change the way we work and live. The world that our students will grow up to is not what we can envision easily today. Many jobs today will be lost or made redundant and new ones, which we do not yet know of or can even imagine, will be created. The challenge is to build strong foundations in our students so that they can thrive in work and life in the future.

  

At Waterway Primary School, we want to develop in every child the passion, the skills and the aptitude for learning so that they will be self-directed to learn, know how to learn and be always ready to acquire new knowledge and skills.

  

The children of today do not learn the same way as the children from 10 years ago. With the deluge of information and the advances of science and technology, the human brain is constantly evolving. Information processing in the brains of our young children takes place simultaneously via multiple
pathways at high speeds. Our challenge is to provide learning opportunities and experiences for our children to help them build and establish new neural networks so that they can explore learning and discover how best they learn.

  

A spectrum of customised distinctive programmes at Waterway Primary School complements classroom teaching and learning. Good Morning School (GMS) is a daily pre-assembly programme students look forward to. Teachers and students share on a wide range of topics such as current affairs, music, art and science to expose students to learning beyond their classrooms, immediate neighbourhood and Singapore. ICT lessons are conducted as part of the curriculum while Flipped Classrooms promote learning any time, every time and everywhere. All P1 and P2 students enjoy Robotics and Coding lessons. All P3 to P6 students learn intermediate level programming and digital media literacy skills.

  

Orators@Waterway and Growth and Benefit Mindset are 2 of the school’s distinctive programmes supported and funded by MOE as an Applied Learning Programme (ALP) and a Learning for Life Programme (LLP) respectively. Orators@Waterway aims to nurture students through public speaking opportunities to be engaging presenters who speak with poise and confidence. With the funds provided, our students enjoy speech and drama lessons and theatre experience. We have also used the funds to set up a broadcasting studio to provide more diverse learning opportunities for our students.

  

In Waterway Primary School, we want to develop a growth and a benefit mindset in our students. While the fixed mindset believes in innate strengths, the growth mindset believes that the brain is malleable and that effort and experience can lead to higher achievement outcomes. The benefit mindset presents the platform to bring to fruition the self-belief and self-improvement that growth mindset develops. It is a purpose driven mindset to think beyond self, to think not of just being better than others but how to be better for others.

  

We provide a holistic education for our students, developing them in all domains – moral, cognitive, physical, social and aesthetics (德、智、体、群、美). In academic learning, we emphasise the learning process over content acquisition. Our curriculum aims to develop in our students, confidence and competence in using the English and Mother Tongue languages; problem solving and thinking skills through Mathematics and Science; positive and lifelong attitudes of a healthy lifestyle through Physical Education; appreciation and enjoyment of the arts through the aesthetics; and sound values through Character Education. We offer Literature from P3 so that through the subject, our young students will have a window to peer out into the world of others and a mirror to hold out and learn about themselves.

  

It is also our aim to build a school based on the strong values of Responsibility, Integrity, Self-Discipline and Empathy (RISE). The very key to a successful person - one who is morally upright, takes care of self, family and others, works well with others and has a zest for life - is self-discipline. It is self-discipline that sets a person apart from the rest. A self-disciplined person makes good decisions to delay immediate gratifications to achieve better outcomes. He/She knows when to forgo play and be focused on working hard. He/She is confident, knows right from wrong and chooses the right behaviour even in the face of adversity. He/She is therefore responsible and has integrity and empathy to make a positive impact on others. 

  

We thank parents for their confidence in us and for their support and encouragement. Our parents are our ambassadors and they play a big part in helping establish the good name the school enjoys with the public. We thank our many community partners. Punggol 21 CC, presented us with many learning opportunities which include performing at events, painting murals at public venues and designing posters for the neighbourhood to promote eco stewardship. Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) and Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT), through the work of their staff in our School Advisory Committee, enriched the learning and experience of our school community. Collaborations with Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) helped fund and train our students in Coding and Robotics. Together, we can and we will scale greater heights.
 
  

We are more than happy to share that our students are our pride. Our wish for them is that they will be like trees planted by the water, who bring forth fruits in good season, whose leaves flourish and who enjoy good success in all they do.
