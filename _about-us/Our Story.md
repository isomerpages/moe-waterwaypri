# Our Story

Waterway Primary School started in 2016 with 5 P1 classes. This quickly grew to 10 P1 classes in 2019, with all 320 places taken. Even in the initial years, the school had proven to be the **school of choice** for many parents although there were other schools that were closer in proximity to their homes. Their decision was based on very good feedback about the school and the programmes the school offers.  
  
Our school aims to prepare students **‘For Work, For Life, For Future’**. **For work** in the **future**, students must enjoy learning, learn continuously and know how to learn so that they can work in jobs in the future economy. **For life**, students must grow up with sound values in order to work and live well with others. Students must have healthy bodies and minds, and have positive lifelong attitudes towards a healthy lifestyle. They must also be able to enjoy the finer aspects of life such as art and music.

Teaching and learning in our school goes beyond prescribed methodologies. **Customised programmes** are designed to engage students to learn. The learning process is emphasised over content acquisition. The curriculum aims of English and Mother Tongue Languages are to develop in our students, confidence and competence in using the languages. Mathematics and Science aim to develop problem-solving and thinking skills.

Over the years, our school has continuously reviewed and refreshed our spectrum of customised **distinctive programmes** which aim to complement classroom teaching and learning. In doing this, we hope to nurture our students into individuals who will thrive in this increasingly complex and uncertain global landscape. 

•	**Good Morning School (GMS)** is a daily pre-assembly programme. Teachers share with students on a wide range of topics such as current affairs, music, art and science to expose students to learning beyond their classrooms, immediate neighbourhood and Singapore.

•	To nurture the spirit of **Innovation &amp; Enterprise (I&amp;E)**, the school provides a vibrant environment where students feel empowered to experiment, collaborate, and discover new possibilities. By integrating Design Thinking, Makers Education, and Entrepreneurship, we provide opportunities for students to solve real-world problems through creativity and practical application.  

•	**Empowering Voices, Cultivating Leaders (EVoCL) Programme** strives to imbue students with critical thinking and oratorical skills, emphasising the interconnectedness of thought and language as foundational elements in shaping leadership competencies. Through such programmes, students’ oratorical skills are honed and they develop into confident leaders, often playing an active role in school events. 

•	In our pursuit of creating a vibrant learning environment, **Curated Programmes** offer students unique, out-of-syllabus experiences that combine fun with learning. Through these specially designed programmes, students explore topics such as growth mindset, coding and robotics, 3D pen fabrication, movie editing with iMovie, just to name a few. Through these specially curated learning opportunities, students are equipped with the essential E21CC skills, preparing them for future success.

•	Through the **Growth and Benefit Mindset (GBM)**, students learn that their abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work. A Benefit Mindset takes the Growth Mindset one step further. Rather than learning and growing just for the sake of individual gain, a Benefit Mindset helps students to apply their strengths to benefit others. The two mindsets are imbued in students through explicit teaching during CCE lessons as well as through integration in subjects across the curriculum. Over the years, students have put into practice the benefit mindset and contributed to society in various ways – organising donation drives for the elderly and immigrants, supporting their younger buddies and contributing to a greener environment through eco-stewardship projects.

As a **part of the School Culture of Care and Excellence**, students are given ample and varied opportunities to practise **student agency**. In the curriculum, they actively seek improvement by engaging in feedback – from peers, teachers, **tapping on affordances** of various technological tools. Students are also given a voice when planning school projects such as Values-in-Action (VIA) projects and the selection of our Head Prefect.  
           
Another salient aspect of our school culture is the practice of **mindfulness**. Mindfulness **is a practice of learning to focus** and being intensely aware of what we are sensing and feeling in the moment, without interpretation or judgement. Practising mindfulness involves breathing methods, guided imagery, and other practices to relax the body and mind, and help reduce stress. 
        
With such practices imbued in our culture, we aim to carve a **Caring and Enabling Learning Environment** that is not only nurturing but also one in which students find joy in learning and pursue lifelong learning.

As our students learn through these meaningful experiences, we nurture in them a spirit to always be the best that they can be, and set themselves ready **For Work, For Life, For Future**.
