<p>The lighthouse is a symbol of direction for the school in the education
of its students. The school aims to build strong foundations for the students
to learn, to learn through life and to be gracious citizens. The tower
is a pillar of strength and hope in a sea of change while the beacon is
the light that shows the way.</p>
