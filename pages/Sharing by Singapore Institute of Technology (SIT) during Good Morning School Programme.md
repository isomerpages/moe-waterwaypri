## Sharing by Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT) during "Good Morning School" Programme


As part of our partnership with SIT, two SIT scholars shared with our students on their area of study (computer engineering) during the “Good Morning School” programme on 13 February 2019.  
  
Our students gained a better understanding on the use of technology in today’s world and had the opportunity to engage in conversations with the presenters.
