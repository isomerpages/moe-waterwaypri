The NPGC3 is an annual competition organised by Wellington Primary School to provide a platform for Primary 4 to 6 students in Singapore to showcase their talents and creativity in developing computer games. The theme of the competition is ‘Smart Nation – Transforming Singapore Through Technology’.

### SGSECURE NATIONAL MOVEMENT

The school is always on the lookout for platforms for our students to grow and benefit others with their strengths.

  

On 4 August 2018, upon invitation by the People's Association (PA), 4 of our students represented the school to share with the Pasir Ris-Punggol community about the SGSecure national movement at the Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC National Day Dinner 2018.

A crowd of about 4000 -- comprising residents in the GRC, grassroot leaders, MPs, and ministers -- was present as our students spoke on stage. In their presentation, our students emphasised the need for us to "Stay Alert, Stay United &amp; Stay Strong" as one Singapore, in light of the spate of terrorist attacks around the world.

We are proud of our students for rising to an occasion like this -- it is definitely no easy task speaking confidently in front of 4000 people. With the strong support from the children's parents and teacher-mentors, coupled with their own hard work over weeks, the presentation was a huge success. We believe we have benefited the community through our presentation.

### POCKET TRIPS

Pocket Trips is an award-winning web-based mobile authoring platform that empowers anyone to create, design and publish their own interactive trails anywhere in the world. With this technology, the teachers at Waterway Primary School facilitated our Primary Two students in a nature trail project on the flora and fauna along the Punggol Waterway Park. The Nature Society Singapore conducted a learning journey for our students to share information on the diverse animals and plants found just behind our school. The students then researched and curated the content presented in this mobile learning app guided by teachers. We hope that you will enjoy this content and learn to appreciate the rich and diverse habitat as you explore the Punggol Waterway Park and the Lorong Halus wetlands.  

  

Please follow our detailed instructions to download the Pocket Trips app and the content presented to you by our Primary Two students of Waterway Primary School.
