## LEARNING EXPERIENCES

We provide a holistic education for our students to prepare them for life and work in the future. We aim to develop in every child the passion, the skills and the aptitude for learning so that they will be self-directed to learn, know how to learn and be always ready to acquire new knowledge and skills.

  

Our programmes are anchored on building character in students so that they will grow up with sound values, be confident persons doing what is good and right, taking care of their family, working well with others and contributing to society. Character and values are not only taught explicitly but are also infused into daily lessons and experiences. Students learn and practise to be gracious, kind and well-mannered.
