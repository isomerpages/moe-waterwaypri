## Minister Wong's Media Visit


Minister of Education, Mr Lawrence Wong, made a media visit to our school on 4 Jan 2021. The various media agencies got to observe the safe management practices the school has in place to ensure the safety of our students.

It was a different first day of school for 3,500 Kindergarten 1 students and 40,000 Primary 1 students in Singapore.

Minister for Education Lawrence Wong visited Waterway Primary School on the morning of Jan. 4 to observe the implementation of safe management measures and to greet students and their parents.

What are our P1 students most looking forward to in school? Making new friends, learning new things, and of course recess time! Glad to see them settling in well at Waterway Primary this morning. Despite COVID-19, we are determined to keep learning going for our students this school year.

The littles ones had the whole primary school to themselves today. While the first day of school may be a little quieter without our older primary school students, we know itâ€™s important for us to welcome the P1s and their parents safely.

Those in secondary schools are more familiar with these routines, and are happy to reunite with their friends after the school holidays. Their teachers encouraged them to continue to be socially responsible, both in and out of school, even as we move into Phase 3.
