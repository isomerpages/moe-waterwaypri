## Good Morning School


Every morning before the start of school, teachers share on subjects ranging from Art, Music, Science, local and international current affairs to engage students and broaden their minds beyond their curriculum.

  

Examples of sharing include Kuala Lumpur â€“ Singapore high-speed rail (HSR), Formula One (F1), history and development changes in Punggol, time zones and seasons at different parts of the world.
