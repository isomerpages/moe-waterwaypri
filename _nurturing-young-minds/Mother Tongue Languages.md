We believe that the mastery of one's mother tongue forms the basis for effective communication and collaboration, promoting an attitude of openness and respect for linguistic diversity, ready to thrive in a globalized society.

**Programmes** <br>
1.	**Mother Tongue Language Fortnight and Cultural Camp/ Experience** <br>
In Waterway Primary, we create an immersive environment for the learning of MTL and to provide platforms for students to actively learn MTL and the associated culture to experience MTL as ‘a living language’. A wide range of class-based, level-based and recess activities related to Chinese, Malay, Tamil languages and culture will be conducted. The Cultural Camp/ Experience provides an immersive environment for students to learn and use their mother tongue in a more in-depth manner, and to appreciate their respective cultures through hands-on tasks such as craft work, learning journey and/ or performances. <br>
2.	Cultural Performance Exposure Scheme (CPES)
An initiative by the Committee to Promote Chinese Language Learning (CPCLL), the Cultural Performance Exposure Scheme (CPES) is an MOE initiative that aims to aims to expose students to Chinese language-related cultural performances by local and foreign performing arts groups. Primary 3 students can look forward to a theatrical experience on Chinese language related performances. <br>
3.	Mother Tongue Language Reading Programme
The MTL Reading Programme aims to instil the passion for reading mother tongue language books that paves the way in the learning of the Language. We hope that our students will be motivated over the years in reading MTL books, starting with igniting the interest in them at the lower primary level. This new initiative started with the engagement of Parent volunteers to conduct story telling for our Primary 2 student in Chinese language during curriculum time last year. We will be extending the programme to all Primary 1 student this year. <br>
4.	Malay Language - Rakan Bahasa (Friends of the language)
Rakan Bahasa is an initiative by the Malay Language Council, Singapore (MLCS) to encourage students who excel in the Malay language to spread the love of the language to their peers, friends and families. As Rakan Bahasa, the students will be given the opportunity to attend various workshops and training sessions conducted by the Duta Bahasa (Language Ambassador), fulfilling roles as reporters, guides or greeters. Students may also assist in facilitating Duta Bahasa talks or in organising Malay-based events for their peers, with support from the teachers.

##### Parent Involvement 

![](/images/Nurturing%20Young%20Minds/Mother%20Language/Reading_Programme_1.jpg)

The MTL Reading Programme – Story Telling for the lower primary, was anchored by our parent volunteers. This was piloted in 2023 with a small group of parent volunteers for the Chinese language Story Telling sessions. 

Moving forward, we would like to extend the Story Telling sessions to include the Malay and Tamil languages. We would like to seek partnership and collaboration with parents who are able to render their service to the school for this programme, to tell stories in the respective Mother Tongue languages to the lower primary students.
