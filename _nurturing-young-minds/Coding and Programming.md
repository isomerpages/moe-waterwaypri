## Coding and Programming


**Aim: To grow a community of digital creators who are passionate in embracing a culture of innovation and co-creation to solve real-world problems.**

At Waterway Primary School, we want to prepare our students for the Digital Century. One of the ways to achieve this is through the introduction of Coding and Programming. This promotes development in student’s computational thinking and problem-solving skills.

  

The school has partnered Infocomm and Media Authority (IMDA) to introduce programmes such as the Code For Fun (CFF) and Digital Maker for our students. These programmes anchor on the academic learning of related concepts using visual-based programming language, such as Scratch. 

  

In the course of students’ coding experience, a combination of robotic kits, such as Lego WeDo, MoWay, and microcontrollers, such as Micro:bit, Arduino and Raspberry Pi are introduced progressively in their learning journey.

  

During each programme, students learn to practice these important steps of computational thinking skills.  

•        Decomposition <br>
•        Algorithm <br>
•        Pattern Recognition <br>
•        Abstraction 

  

Through these learning opportunities, students are equipping themselves with problem-solving skills that will help them enhance their learning of mathematics, science and other subjects, and even to solve problems in daily life.

  

Following on from the P1 and P2 PAL Robotics, the P3 to P6 students would have Coding and Programming as part of our Modular CCA and Interest CCA.
