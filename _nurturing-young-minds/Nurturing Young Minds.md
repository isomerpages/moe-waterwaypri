## Nurturing Young Minds

In academic learning, we emphasise process over content. Learning must be fun and meaningful and emphasis is placed on the learning process. Lessons are customised according to the needs and progress of the students. We want to develop students to be confident and competent users of English and their Mother Tongue Languages. Through Mathematics and Science, we want to develop studentsâ€™ problem solving and thinking process skills.
