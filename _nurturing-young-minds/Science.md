&gt;LEARNING EXPERIENCES

## Science

A brief introduction to the department's role and significance within the primary school.

The Science department plays a pivotal role in nurturing young minds, fostering a love for exploration, and cultivating a deep appreciation for the wonders of the natural world.

Our dedicated team of educators is committed to providing a stimulating and engaging learning environment where curiosity knows no bounds. Science is not just a subject; it's a gateway to understanding the fascinating phenomena that shape our universe. From the tiniest particles to the vastness of outer space, we embark on an exciting journey of discovery with our students.

Our mission is to instill a lifelong love for learning and inquiry, laying the foundation for critical thinking and problem-solving skills that extend far beyond the classroom. We believe that every child is a natural scientist, eager to explore, question, and make sense of the world around them.

We go beyond textbooks, encouraging hands-on experiments, interactive projects, and real-world applications. We strive to create an atmosphere where students feel empowered to ask "why" and "how" as they embark on the adventure of scientific exploration.

**Department Goals and how they help achieve 21 CC:**
Outline the key goals and objectives for the academic year or term.

We aim to inspire a love for learning by nurturing the innate curiosity within each student. We strive to create an environment where science becomes a gateway to endless possibilities, encouraging students to question, explore, and analyze the world around them. Through engaging experiences and interactive learning, we aim to instill a lifelong commitment to scientific inquiry and critical thinking.

**Goals:** <br>
1.	Cultivate Curiosity: We are dedicated to awakening and sustaining the natural curiosity present in every student. Through intriguing experiments, hands-on activities, and thought-provoking questions, we aim to ignite a genuine interest in the wonders of science. <br>
2.	Promote Inquiring Minds: Our goal is to develop inquiring minds that actively seek knowledge and understanding. We encourage students to ask questions, investigate phenomena, and develop a sense of wonder that extends beyond the classroom. <br>
3.	Nurture Critical Thinking: We prioritize the development of critical thinking skills by challenging students to analyze information, evaluate evidence, and draw well-reasoned conclusions. Through scientific inquiry, students learn to think independently and approach problems with analytical minds. <br>
4.	Encourage Exploration: We strive to create an environment that fosters exploration and experimentation. Students are provided with opportunities to explore various scientific concepts, conduct experiments, and apply their knowledge to real-world scenarios. <br>
5.	Inspire a Lifelong Love for Science: Our ultimate goal is to inspire a lifelong love for science. By providing engaging and meaningful learning experiences, we aim to create a foundation that goes beyond academic achievement, instilling a genuine passion for the scientific process and discovery.

We aim to empower students not only with scientific knowledge but also with the skills and mindset needed to approach the world with curiosity, inquiry, and critical thinkingâ€”qualities essential for success in learning.
