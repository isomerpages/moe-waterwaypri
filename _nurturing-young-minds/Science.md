## Science

**Aim: Curious Learners with an Inquiring & Critical Thinking Mind**

  

We provide students with experiences to engage them in being curious about their surroundings and in thinking critically so as to develop good attitudes and habits in their journey as a science inquirer.

  

We take students on learning journeys to experience the outdoor classroom and to interact with the diversity of things in their surroundings. We nurture them to appreciate their environment and to take responsibility in conservation efforts.

  

Our 3Es framework of Enthuse, Explore, Experience anchors on inquiry-based approach in teaching.
