##### Overview

In Waterway Primary School, we believe that ‘Every Waterway Student is a Leader’. With that, the committee aims to develop student leaders through school wide programmes and specific skills training at every level towards a holistic and balanced participation. All students in Waterway Primary School have an opportunity to get basic leadership skills and grow as a leader. The committee has also designed tiered programmes to develop our students to be leaders of tomorrow, who will serve with conviction and dedication. 

##### Student Leadership Mission
The Student Leadership Programme in Waterway Primary School aims to nurture our students to become confident and responsible individuals who have self-discipline, integrity and empathy, and can contribute to the betterment of self and others with a Growth and Benefit mindset.  

##### Student Leadership Framework

The Student Leadership Framework sets a hierarchy for all Student Leaders in the School. All students undergo the Tier 1 training during CCE and FTGP lessons which provide students with the necessary set of skills to attain Self-Leadership. Tier 2 leaders hold appointments within the classroom and CCA. Tier 3 Leaders hold responsibilities beyond their classrooms and CCA. Tier 4 Leaders hold responsibilities and commitment to lead the other leaders.

Tier 2 to Tier 4 leaders undergo training specific to their roles and responsibilities. In addition, Tier 3 and Tier 4 leaders may also be engaged in school programmes as well as student initiated projects that may benefit the school and the community. 

##### Student Leadership Tiers and Roles
The school has designed different Tiers for our leaders. The Tiers framework sets a way to map the students’ achievements and chart their leadership progress  as they advance from tier to tier.
