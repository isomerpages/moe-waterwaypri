## Information &amp; Communications Technology (ICT)

The Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) Committee is a team of educators working to enhance the digital learning experience at Waterway Primary School.

Here at Waterway Primary School, we aim to create an ICT pervasive learning environment where responsible ICT-savvy learners thrive. -	A part of our vision for the school is to see **Digitally Savvy Global Citizens of Tomorrow, Today.**
