## Information & Communications Technology (ICT)


**Aim: Students to be proficient in using ICT for active and self-directed learning in a responsible, respectful and reflective way for the present and future world**

  

At Waterway Primary, the school’s pervasive ICT environment engages students to acquire appropriate skills and technologies for the present and future world. There is seamless integration of ICT into daily lessons to enhance students’ learning.  

  

Our Primary 1 students begin their ICT learning as early as the start of Semester 2. These young learners participate in 1 hour of ICT lessons per week. Our ICT lessons harness the functional affordances of different ICT tools such as word processors, spreadsheets, social networking sites, collaborative writing tools, and multimedia presentation and publishing tools. These lessons offer students opportunities to practise their ICT skills.
