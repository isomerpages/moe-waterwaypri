## Art Club

The Art Club provide students with opportunities to experiment with various art forms such as painting, drawing, sculpture, and digital art. By exploring different materials and techniques, students can discover their preferences and strengths, allowing them to develop their unique artistic style. Students are nurtured to think and express themselves creatively through enjoyable and meaningful art making as well as exploring and experimenting with different media and materials. 

While individual creativity is valued, the CCA also provide opportunities for collaborative brainstorming, critique, and feedback. Students are encouraged to share ideas, collaborate, and provide constructive criticism to their peers. Through collaboration, students learn to consider different viewpoints, refine their ideas, and find creative solutions to artistic challenges. This collaborative spirit fosters a sense of community and camaraderie within the Art Club, enriching the creative experience for all members.

The objective of Art Club@Waterway is to provide students with opportunities to explore, learn, and grow as student artists, while fostering a love for the arts and developing their creativity. We provide a safe space for students to explore their creativity through various artistic mediums such as drawing, painting, sculpture, digital art, etc. 

Our students are encouraged to express themselves through meaningful art making, allowing them to communicate their thoughts, feelings, and ideas in a visual form. Through engaging in the different artistic activities, students develop critical thinking skills as they experiment with different materials, techniques, and approaches to creating art.

In Art Club, our students also develop a deeper appreciation and understanding of various artistic influences from around the world through exposure to different art styles, trends, techniques, and cultures.
