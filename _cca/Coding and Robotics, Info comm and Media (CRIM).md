<p>‚ÄúOur CCA is fun and interesting, we can build robots and do codes to get
it to move. It feels nice to see our own creation doing something we have
coded.‚Äù - Tara Zee, P5C 2025</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>‚ÄúI have learned how to use the Thunkable app creation and now I am currently
learning the Cospaces. I like the way the teacher teaches and using the
laptop. I work collaboratively with my friends on Thunkable. We discuss
what we can do and test our app.‚Äù - Vishranthan Aadhi Sheshwaran S/O Sivashankar,
