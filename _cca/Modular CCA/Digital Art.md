## Digital Art

Digital Art is introduced in 2020 to all Primary 4 students as one of the MCCA modules. The objectives of this module are to achieve proficient technical and aesthetic skills using various technology tools to generate a broad range of two dimensional images. The Primary 4 students will be learning about manga. They will use the tablets to draw their manga style characters they have created for a series of posters related to contemporary issues in school. This module is also part of the Primary 4 _Values In Action_ (VIA) project – to educate students to be socially responsible individuals who contribute meaningfully to ensure that the school is a clean and safe environment. The posters designed by the students will be printed out and used in school.
