## Swimsafer Programme

All P3 students will undergo the Swimsafer Programme as part of the PE curriculum and P3 MCCA. Students will learn about water safety, personal water survival and swimming strokes. They are grouped according to their abilities. At the end of the programme, each student has a chance to earn a Swimsafer certificate if he/she successfully passes both the practical and theory assessment.
