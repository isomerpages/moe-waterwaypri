## Choir

![](/images/CCA/Choir%201.jpg)

Waterway Primary School Choir was established in January 2019 as a platform to promote healthy vocal awareness and the joy in choral singing amongst our students.  

  

In Choir, the students are exposed to a variety of languages, cultures, rhythmic patterns and music around the world through a variety of song repertoire. The vocal training activities are conducted in a creative way to motivate the students to:

  

\-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;practise proper breathing techniques

  

\-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;use the larynx efficiently

  

\-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;engage in proper body posture

  

\-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;develop self-confidence for performance

  

\-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;strengthen pitching and do simple note-reading

As junior choristers, the students will have opportunities to develop leadership skills through guiding new choir members and leading vocal warm up and sectional practices (soprano and alto).

As senior choristers, the students will work alongside with their peers and teachers to manage administrative and logistical processes for rehearsals and performances.
