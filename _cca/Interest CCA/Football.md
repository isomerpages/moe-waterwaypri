## Football

Our Football CCA aims to develop students’ techniques and skills in football through progressive, structured training with a strong emphasis on character building.

At&nbsp;Primary 3 and 4, students&nbsp;are&nbsp;trained in the basic skills of passing, dribbling, shooting and heading. They will also be exposed to actual game&nbsp;situations&nbsp;through friendly matches. At&nbsp;Primary 5 and 6,&nbsp;students’&nbsp;skills&nbsp;will&nbsp;be&nbsp;further honed&nbsp;as they also learn about the&nbsp;tactical aspects of the game at a more competitive level.&nbsp;This is to&nbsp;prepare them to represent the school in the National School Games.

As the students engage in rigorous training during&nbsp;the Football&nbsp;CCA, the school values of Responsibility, Integrity, Self-discipline and Empathy (R.I.S.E) will be inculcated&nbsp;in them. It is essential for students to understand the importance of teamwork, strive for excellence and play with good sportsmanship.

In line with our school’s vision of nurturing life-long learners and gracious citizens, we hope students will learn to demonstrate graciousness, show respect and play with sportsmanship. The values of teamwork, collaboration and graciousness will prepare them not just for the game, but for life.
