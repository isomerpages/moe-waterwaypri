## Cub Scouts

The mission of Scouting is to contribute to the education of young people, through a value system based on the Scout Promise and Law. This supports the vision of building a better world where people are self-fulfilled as individuals and play a constructive role in society.

At Waterway Primary School, guided by our school values of Responsibility, Integrity, Self – Discipline and Empathy, we aim to infuse fun into the scouting sessions while imparting important skills and knowledge. Self-developmental activities are well-entrenched components of the scouting programme to encourage the element of “Fun & Discovery” amongst the Cubs.

We aim to provide a group environment, which is intellectually stimulating and directed towards satisfying the child’s basic needs to face and overcome challenges. Through the CCA, we strive to imbue integrity as one key foundation of character in the students as well as develop them to become independent, confident, responsible and empathetic individuals.

### Progress Awards

Starting from this early development stages, Cub Scouts will aim to earn a series of Badges, which give them a knowledge of basic Scouting skills and mark achievements in areas such as campcraft, air and water activities, citizenship and improving the environment.

The Cub Scouts Section Training Scheme is divided into 3 progress badges and a highest award:  

• Bronze Arrow

• Silver Arrow

• Gold Arrow

• Akela Award

Each progress badge comprises tests for Citizenship, Leadership and Responsibility, Physical Skills, Self Reliance, Adventure and Fun.

The highest award in this section is the Akela Award, where a Cub Scout must hold the Gold Arrow and pass specific proficiency badges, show general knowledge of scouting and successfully complete an interview with the District Commissioner.

### Hiking


Our Cub Scouts brought their contributions a step forward and fostered a stronger sense of community by participating in the North Area’s Founders’ Day Hike in the neighbourhood, organized by the Singapore Scouts Association and met other scouts from the area, strengthening the unique fellowship of scouting from the experience.

### Camping

Our Cub Scouts participated in the North Area End-of-Year Camp, “Camp Jolly Roger” organized by the Singapore Scouts Association. As the name suggests, the theme of the camp is to build and develop a relationship between a diverse group of people through some fun and collaborative activities. Hence strengthening their unity. Students honed their core Scouting Skills like outdoor cooking and knotting and develop core socioemotional competencies like leadership and teamwork.
