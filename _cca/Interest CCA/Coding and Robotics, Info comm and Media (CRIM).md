## Coding and Robotics, Info-comm and Media (CRIM)

At Waterway Primary School, the vision is to prepare our students for the future. One such area of focus is in the field of Coding and Robotics, Info communication and Media (CRIM). While the foundations are laid out in P1 and P2 PAL robotics, the learning of Computational Thinking Skills (CoTS) does not end there. Students who show potential and interest in CRIM can choose to participate in the CRIM Interest CCA to further hone their CoTS. 

**Educational Goals:** <br>
Students who join CRIM Club will be stretched further to develop computational thinking skills at an advanced level. In addition, we aim to hone their critical design thinking and crafting skills through school based activities and national competitions. In the process, we strive to build confidence and different skillsets in our members, bringing out the best in each student. With a broad exposure to a range of robotics sets and info communication and media platforms, student's joy of learning and savviness in technology will be enhanced as well. 

**Skill Development:** <br>
•	Computational thinking <br>
•	Critical design thinking <br>
•	Crafting

**Educational Benefits** <br>
21st Centuries Competencies will be developed. <br>
•	Critical thinking <br>
•	Creativity and innovation <br>
•	Collaboration <br>
•	Communication

**Personal Development** <br>
Through hands-on activities during CCA and participation in National Competition, students collaborate and persevere to work towards common goals and develop values such as respect and self-discipline to overcome the various challenges encountered. 

**Regular Activities:** <br>
Coding and Robotics – EV3 and Spike Prime Robotics Set
Info communication and Media – Minecraft Education; Thunkable and Python coding

**Special events:** <br>
Competition: First Lego League; National Primary Games Creation and Coding Competition; National Infocomm League; World Robo Olympiad Singapore
