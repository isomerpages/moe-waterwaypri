## Coding and Robotics, Info-comm and Media (CRIM)


At Waterway Primary, the vision is to prepare our students for the future. One such area is in programming. While the foundations laid out in P1 and P2 PAL robotics, the learning of Computational Thinking Skills (CoTS) does not end there. Students who show potential in coding, robotics or info-comm skills are selected to participate in the CRIM Interest CCA.

These students will be stretched further to develop coding and computational thinking at an advanced level. In the process, we strive to build confidence and skills in our members, bringing out the best in each student.

 In CRIM, students are exposed to various programming languages such as Scratch and Python, which will take them far in life if they choose to pursue programming in the future. During their time in CRIM, they will also combine their programming knowledge with robotic kits such as Lego WeDo, Lego EV3 and microcontrollers like Micro:bits, to expose them to the field of robotics and spark their imagination and passion. Finally, they are exposed to the world of game building where they will build a Smart City using the Minecraft programme to encourage creativity and real-world problem solving.

Students will be given a chance to participate in any potential CRIM-related competitions such as the National Primary Games Creation and Coding Competition, World Robo Tournament and  East Zone DSTA-DSO Robotics Challenge.
