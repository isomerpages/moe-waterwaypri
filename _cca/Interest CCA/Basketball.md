Basketball Interest CCA for Primary 3 to Primary 6 students provides them with an enriching experience in sports and exposes them to the game of basketball. Students are taught the rules of basketball and will develop basic basketball skills so that they are equipped to play the game. They will also enjoy the health benefits of being active through sports.

Basketball provides the opportunity for the students to understand and experience the benefits of good communication and negotiation skills, as they learn to play in teams. They learn about good sportsmanship, gracious behavior, the value of resilience and the importance of team collaboration – skill sets and values to navigate their own future and life.
