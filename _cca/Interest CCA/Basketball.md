Students are taught the rules of basketball and develop basic basketball skills so&nbsp;that they are equipped to play the&nbsp;game and enjoy the health benefits of being active through sports. Basketball also provides the opportunity for the students to understand and experience the benefits of good communication and negotiation skills, as they learn to play in a team. They learn about good sportsmanship, gracious behavior, the value of resilience and the importance of team collaboration â€“ skill sets and values to navigate their own future and life.
