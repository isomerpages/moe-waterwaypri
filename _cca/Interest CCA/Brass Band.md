Waterway Primary School Brass Band (WAPBB) aims to be


**“A happy band where bandbees grow and shine! ”**

We provide opportunities for students to learn music by playing an instrument in an ensemble setting.&nbsp;Our CCA&nbsp;offers a broad and holistic educational experience, and builds the foundation for further&nbsp;music-related&nbsp;leisure activity, or even for a career in the music industry.

The brass band instruments include the trumpet, horn, trombone, euphonium, tuba and percussion. Learning to play an instrument requires commitment, time and effort. The BEE is therefore chosen as the band mascot, symbolising&nbsp;**_fervour, perseverance and teamwork_**, the distinctive&nbsp;traits of bandbee (band member), rooted in the school values of R.I.S.E.

Activities for bandbees include mastering an instrument, putting up performances (in school and externally), attending concerts and enjoying team building games. Selected students also participate in external band workshops and performances.

There will also be leadership opportunities for WAPBB members to hone their soft skills and develop them into well-rounded individuals.

Creating music as "One Band, One Sound" encourages members to synergise as a team. The band experience will be an integral part of each bandbee’s primary school journey, providing them with skills and friendships which they will carry with them for a long time to come.
