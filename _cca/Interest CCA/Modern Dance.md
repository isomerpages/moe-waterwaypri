## Modern Dance

Modern Dance CCA seeks to inspire students who are passionate in dance. We aim to grow their dance talent and develop their skills.

Besides ethnic dance, students also learn contemporary dance styles such as Hip Hop and Jazz through this CCA. Under the guidance of experienced dance teachers and instructors, we aim to provide students with a robust foundation in dance.

The school's values of Responsibility and Self-discipline are fostered through the strong rigor in our dance practices, where students learn and master different dance techniques and styles in a safe, enriching environment.

As students perform choreographed dance routines together, they learn how to communicate and work together as a team, reinforcing the school's values of Empathy and Integrity.

 Moreover, leadership qualities are also inculcated in the CCA. We seek to build resilience and hone confidence in our members, motivating them to become active team leaders. Our termly CCA Facilitation and Reflection lessons seek to further develop character, improving social emotional competencies and other pertinent life skills to prepare them for the future.

Students are presented with an abundance of opportunities to showcase their learning through various school events. These events include National Day and Prize Giving Day. The school also expose our Modern Dance students to external events such as the National Day Observance Ceremony at MOE HQ. In addition, dancers who exhibit good learning attitude and outstanding dance ability are nominated to represent the school in inter-school presentations such as the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF).

**International Dance – National Day 2023 Performance @ MOE HQ** <br>
Our dancers were invited to perform at MOE Headquarters to celebrate National Day 2023 last year. In the presence of our Minister of Education, Mr. Chan Chun Sing, and various MOE officers, our dancers awed the audience with their graceful dance moves, choreographed to bear resemblance of a resilient flower that blossoms through hard conditions. Other notable events include Super Champions, SYF Showcase in the neighbourhood, and SYF Performance.
