## Art Club


Waterway Primary School Art Club is a new CCA that started in 2020. Art is a universal language that can be creatively interpreted and created by anyone. The creative process of creating an art piece can also bring about a therapeutic effect in calming one’s senses – offering individuals an outlet to unwind.

With the purpose of providing an outlet for self-expression and to enjoy the process of creation, the school’s Art Club aims to create a friendly and safe environment that is conducive for art enthusiasts and novices to express themselves through different mediums and various art forms. This also allows them to further develop their interest and love for Art.

Our Art Club provides a platform for Art enthusiasts and novices to take part in activities that extend beyond the formal Art curriculum and aims to instill interest through exploring, expressing and appreciating the different Art forms. Every child is an artist and has a story to tell and the school’s Art Club aims to help our young artists’ stories and imagination become real through fun and enjoyable art making experiences.

In addition to developing the student’s skills and knowledge in Art, the CCA also aims to develop the student’s school values as well as the following outcomes in the student:

**A** – Attitude (Be positive and try your best!)

**R** – Respect (Respect everyone and everything.)

**T** – Think and Talk (Make good choices.)

**C** – Creative (Be Imaginative.)

**L** – Lifelong Learning (Learning New Concepts, Mediums and Techniques.)

**U** – Understand (Elements of Art & Principles of Design.)

**B** – Brave (Be experimental and observant.)

Waterway Primary School Art Club’s programme is divided into 4 categories.
