## Table Tennis

Table Tennis started in Waterway Primary School in 2021. The sessions are helmed by teachers who strive to nurture the love for the sports. Adopting the play-practice approach, we introduce elements of table tennis through the mini-games.

Beyond skills and techniques, we aim to leverage CCA as a platform for students to develop their character, learn values, social emotional competencies and skills to prepare them for future challenges.
