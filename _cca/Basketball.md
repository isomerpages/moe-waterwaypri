<h2>Basketball</h2>
<p>Basketball Interest CCA is an exciting opportunity for Primary 3 to Primary
6 students to explore the sport of basketball in a fun and supportive environment.
Through structured training sessions, students will learn the fundamental
rules of the game and develop essential basketball skills such as dribbling,
passing, and shooting.</p>
<p>Beyond improving their technical abilities, students will also experience
the joy of teamwork, discipline, and perseverance. Engaging in regular
physical activity through basketball helps them build fitness, coordination,
and confidence while fostering a lifelong appreciation for sports.</p>
<p>Basketball provides students with the opportunity to take ownership of
their learning and develop agency as they actively engage in team dynamics,
strategise plays, and make real-time decisions on the court. As they learn
to play in teams, they cultivate essential communication and negotiation
skills, understanding how to express their ideas clearly, listen to teammates,
and adapt to different game situations.</p>
<p>The school values of Responsibility, Integrity, Self-discipline, and Empathy
are also reinforced through collaborative team play, shaping students into
well-rounded individuals with strong character and interpersonal skills.</p>
<p>From a cognitive learning perspective, basketball enhances students’ cognitive
processes by engaging their attention, encoding new strategies, storing
tactical knowledge, and retrieving learned skills during gameplay.</p>
<p>The fast-paced nature of the sport sharpens focus, improves memory recall,
and strengthens decision-making abilities, all of which contribute to academic
learning. Additionally, basketball promotes positive outcomes such as improved
physical health, stress management, and enhanced problem-solving skills,
reinforcing students’ ability to balance both their studies and extracurricular
pursuits.</p>
<p>Through these experiences, they also internalise key values such as good
sportsmanship, gracious behavior, resilience, and teamwork—important life
skills that empower them to navigate their future with confidence and adaptability.</p>
<p>The CCA also provides a platform for students to grow as leaders while
developing essential 21st Century Competencies (21CC) such as communication,
collaboration, and resilience.</p>
<p>Those who demonstrate leadership qualities and strong teamwork may be
identified for key roles such as team captains and CCA leaders, where they
will receive guidance to hone their decision-making and problem-solving
skills.</p>
<p>Through these leadership opportunities, students also develop affective
domain competencies, such as empathy, responsibility, and sportsmanship,
fostering a positive and inclusive team culture.</p>
