## International Chess

The International Chess Club is a co-curricular activity where students learn and develop their skills in playing chess. It provides an opportunity for students to enhance their strategic thinking, analytical abilities, and engage in friendly competition through the game of chess.

The Chess Club aligns with the school's objectives of nurturing higher-order thinking skills, analytical abilities, and intellectual growth through extracurricular activities.

Participation in the Chess Club helps students develop skills such as:
- Strategic thinking and problem-solving
- Memory and recall
- Anticipation and planning
- Concentration and focus
- Sportsmanship and respect

The activity enhances academic learning by improving logical reasoning, decision-making, and critical thinking abilities, which are valuable across various subjects.

Being part of the Chess Club fosters personal growth and character development by instilling qualities such as discipline, respect, integrity, resilience, and self-confidence, which align with the school's values, RISE. In addition, the Chess Club encourages its senior members to take on leadership roles, mentoring and guiding the younger members, fostering a supportive and collaborative learning environment.

The Chess Club conducts weekly training sessions facilitated by a professional chess trainer. During these sessions, members learn various strategies, openings, tactics, and end-game techniques. Active discussions and analyses of chess positions take place, allowing participants to deepen their understanding of the game. Additionally, mini tournaments are organized within the club, providing opportunities for members to apply their newly acquired skills in practice matches.
