We provide opportunities for students to learn music by playing an instrument in an ensemble setting. Our CCA aims to offer a broad and holistic educational experience, and builds the foundation for further music-related leisure activity, or even for a career in the music industry.

Activities for bandbees include mastering an instrument, putting up performances (in school and externally), attending concerts and enjoying team building games. Selected students also participate in external band workshops and performances.

There will also be leadership opportunities for WAPBB members to hone their soft skills and develop them into well-rounded individuals.
