<p>We provide opportunities for students to learn music by playing an instrument
in an ensemble setting. Our CCA aims to offer a broad and holistic educational
experience, and builds the foundation for further music-related leisure
activity, or even for a career in the music industry.</p>

<p>Activities for bandbees include mastering an instrument, putting up performances
(in school and externally), attending concerts and enjoying team building
games. Selected students also participate in external band workshops and
performances.</p>
<p>There will also be leadership opportunities for WAPBB members to hone
their soft skills and develop them into well-rounded individuals.</p>

<p>The band experience will be an integral part of each Bandbee’s primary
school journey, providing them with skills and friendships which they will
carry with them for a long time to come.</p>
<p><strong>Educational Goals:</strong> 
<br>• Inspire students to appreciate music through resilience and performance
opportunities
<br>• Cultivate responsibility to the Music they are learning and performing
<br>• Cultivate integrity to play the music wholly as per composed or edited
with the consent of the composer
<br>• Self-discipline to keep learning and horning their skills
<br>• Empathy to understand the learning difficulties that other Bandbees
experienced and support each other along the path of learning</p>
<p><strong>Skill Development:</strong> 
<br>• Teamwork - by learning to play in a group you learn to work together
to make music.
<br>• Concentration – playing music requires concentration, and learning to
play in a group helps develop concentration.
<br>• Development of Motor Skills in playing in a Brass Band.</p>
<p><strong>Educational Benefits:</strong> 
<br>• Numeracy and logic – learning music is proven to assist in developing
mathematical skills and logic skills.
<br>• Developing Social Skills - being a part of a group with individuals
that share similar interests will help build and strengthen a connection
to other people.
<br>• Music is one of the seven intelligences identified in the brain and
the only one that utilizes all seven intelligences simultaneously. Students
who participate in music courses exercise more of their brain than in any
other course they take in school.</p>
