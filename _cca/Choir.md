<p>Waterway Primary School Choir was established in January 2019 as a platform
to promote healthy vocal awareness and the joy in choral singing amongst
our students.</p>
<p>Students are taught various singing techniques and are exposed to a wide
range of songs. They are also provided with opportunities to develop the
school values of responsibility and self-discipline as they balance schoolwork
and regular choir practices, learn new skills, languages and songs. They
are also required to display the values of empathy and integrity where
they need to work together as a team and help one another to improve in
their vocal techniques.</p>
<p>In Choir, the students are exposed to a different languages, cultures,
rhythmic patterns and music around the world through their song repertoire.
The vocal training activities are conducted in a creative way to motivate
the students to
<br>• practise proper breathing techniques</p>
<p>• use the larynx efficiently</p>
<p>• engage in good and proper body posture</p>
<p>• develop self-confidence for performance</p>
<p>• strengthen pitching and do simple note-reading</p>
<p>Students will have opportunities to develop leadership skills through
guiding new choir members, leading vocal warm ups and even assisting teachers
to manage administrative and logistical processes for rehearsals and performances.
<br>
<br>Students develop self-discipline, resilience and confidence as they grow
their passion in singing. They learn to overcome their individual challenges
and pursue excellence through their journey in Choir
<br>
<br>Students can apply what they have learnt both techniques and life skills
in their academics and other areas of life. Pronunciation and articulation
are critical in singing which they can apply in their daily speaking. Learning
new songs are cognitively stimulating and helps in their memory too!
<br>
<br>The self-discipline they develop during the trainings would benefit them
as it becomes a way of life. Over time, students also build resilience
as they perfect the choral pieces – they learn how to be critical thinkers
to analyse how they can improve their singing individually and as a group.
They learn how to embrace challenges and persist even when they fail in
the pursuit of excellence.</p>

<p><strong>Testimonials:</strong>

<p>Hing Gek Joo (5B,2025)</p>
<p>I learn how to sing different songs and activating my singing voice to
sing instead of my talking voice. I have grown to become a more responsible
person&nbsp; - from not knowing what to bring, I asked and put in effort
to remember to bring my choir file, water bottle and pencil case for every
training session. One challenge for me is I often forget the tune that
I am supposed to sing. To overcome this challenge, I would go home and
practise till I get it! I feel proud when I earned my instructor’s affirmation
that I’ve gotten my notes right!</p>
<p>Rayna Png (6G, 2025)</p>
<p>I like being in Choir because it lets me express myself through singing.
Although I am not confident yet to sing in front of other people, I still
enjoy singing a lot. Over the 3 years in Choir, I’ve learnt to be patient
especially when instructor is working with other members on their pitch
and rhythm. One challenge I face is I may not be able to keep up the pace
of memorizing the lyrics and tune as my friends but I don’t give up. Perseverance
pays off. My proudest moment was when I get the opportunity to participate
in the Singapore Youth Festival 2024 and achieved the Certificate of Accomplishment
as a team.</p>
<p>Natalie Sim (4F, 2025)</p>
<p>Being in the Choir big family, I&nbsp;get to know more people from other
classes. I get the opportunity to practice and improve my vocals too through
the various techniques and skills learnt.</p>
<p>In the choir, we have to stand throughout the practice session and it
can be quite tiring. I learn to be more resillent and focus on the singing
rather than the tiredness. I also learn to be responsible to bring my things
needed for Choir every time. Being in a big Choir, I also build self-discipline&nbsp;to
engage in active listening and not talk while instructor is working with
other members.</p>
<p>I first performed in Prize Giving Day in Primary 3 and am looking forward
to more performances!</p>
<p>Ferlyn Wan (6G, 2025)</p>
<p>I like being in the Choir as I get to learn many singing techniques and
breathing exercises! Our Choir teachers and instructor make learning fun
as there are interesting activities for us to bond and sing better! My
interest in singing has grown over time and I have decided that I would
like to continue joining the choir in secondary school. One challenge I
face is there were some difficult tunes that I could not sing well. However,
I managed to overcome it with practice and effort! I am proud to be a member
of Waterway Primary School Choir.</p>
