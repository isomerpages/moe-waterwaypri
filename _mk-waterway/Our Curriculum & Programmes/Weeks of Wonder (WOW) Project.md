<h4>Weeks of Wonder Projects</h4>
<p>In these projects, children work together to investigate topics that interest
them.</p>
<p>Each term at MOE Kindergarten (MK) culminates in a Weeks of Wonder (WoW)
project. In a year, children complete 2 WoW projects in English and another
2 in their Mother Tongue Language (MTL). Children will work together with
their friends on a topic of their choice.</p>
<p>Through WoW projects, children learn to:
<br>• Make their own decisions.
<br>• Solve problems and use process skills to make sense of the world around
them.
<br>• Collaborate with one another.
<br>• Communicate confidently in English and their MTL.</p>
<p>Through the process of finding answers to their own questions, WoW projects
allow children to:
<br>• Experience the joy of self-motivated learning.
<br>• Build their confidence.
<br>• Strengthen their learning dispositions or positive behaviours and attitudes
towards learning.</p>
