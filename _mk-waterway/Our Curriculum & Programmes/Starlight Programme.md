<h4><strong>Starlight Programme</strong></h4>
<p>Our Starlight Literacy Programme nurtures the children’s language skills
through Big Books, songs, rhymes and games set in the local context.</p>
<p>Language learning is a dynamic and ongoing process that begins in infancy
and early childhood and continues throughout the schooling years. In early
childhood, the focus is on developing children’s listening and speaking
skills. An active, interactive approach helps to nurture children’s interest
in learning languages.</p>
<p>We use Big Books, songs, rhymes and games to help your child to:</p>
<p>• Develop listening, speaking and early literacy skills.
<br>• Enjoy English and their Mother Tongue Language (MTL) (i.e. Chinese,
Malay or Tamil language).
<br>• Communicate with confidence.
<br>• Learn about local customs and traditions.</p>
<p>MTL and bilingualism</p>
<p>Bilingualism is a cornerstone of Singapore’s education system. Learning
our MTL gives us direct access to our cultural heritage, and can help us
better understand our values, roots and identities.</p>
<p>At MK, we nurture bilingualism by focusing on listening, speaking and
engaging children in games and activities that encourage early literacy
development.</p>
<p>By using their MTL to communicate with teachers and their friends on a
daily basis, children build a strong foundation that will prepare them
for language learning in later years.</p>
<p>Our MK offers classes in the 3 official MTLs (Chinese, Malay and Tamil).
We encourage children of Chinese, Malay and Indian ethnic race to take
their own MTLs.</p>
