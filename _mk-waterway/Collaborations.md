<p><strong>Collaborations with Families (LIFE@MK)</strong>
<br>Families play an important role in nurturing children’s holistic development.
We routinely involve families in children’s learning through our series
of workshops and sharing sessions under the Leading and Inspiring Families
of Early Learners @ MOE Kindergarten (<strong>LIFE@MK</strong>) programme.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Our MK educators will share:
<br>•What your child learns at MK.
<br>•Educational approaches that are appropriate for your child’s development.
<br>•Practical tips to help you nurture your child's holistic development
at home.&nbsp;
<br>•Information on specific topics, such as supporting your child’s transition
to primary school.</p>

<p><strong>With Primary school (K2-P1 Transition Programme)</strong>
<br>To prepare for their transition to primary school, the K2 children participated
in a series of hands-on activities designed to help them feel confident
and familiar with their soon-to-be environment. They interviewed primary
school teachers and visited key places around the school, such as the canteen,
library, and bookshop. They even got to experience a day in the life of
a Primary One student by taking part in the morning assembly, flag-raising
ceremony, recess, and lessons! Throughout the programmes, they radiated
smiles and laughter, excitedly awaiting to kickstart their journey in this
important new chapter!</p>

<p><strong>With Parent Support Group (PSG)</strong>
<br>At MK@Waterway, we believe that strong home-school partnerships are essential
for fostering children's success during their early years. When families
and educators work together, we can create a supportive and vibrant learning
community that nurtures every child’s potential.</p>
<p>Our Parent Support Group’s Parent Volunteers play a crucial role in this
partnership by contributing their time, knowledge, and unique perspectives.
They actively participated in various Learning Journeys organized by the
school, supporting the children’s learning beyond the walls of the classroom.
Additionally, Parent Volunteers also helped to facilitate events such as
Racial Harmony Day, helping to engage the children and enrich their learning
experiences. We sincerely appreciate their consistent and steadfast support.</p>
