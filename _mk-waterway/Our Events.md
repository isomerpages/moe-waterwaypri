<h3><strong>Check Out Some of the Fun Events We Had in 2025!</strong></h3>
<p></p>
<h4>Book Week 2025</h4>
<p>We celebrated ‘Book Week’ with the theme “The World of Eric Carle”, where
children learnt about the renowned author of many popular children’s books!
We invited our very own Parent Support Group to retell stories such as
“From Head to Toe” and “Pancakes, Pancakes!” while engaging the children
in singing, dancing, and pancake-making. We ended ‘Book Week’ by dressing
up as our favourite characters from Eric Carle’s books! It was dazzling
to witness the creativity of both parents and children in crafting their
outfits.</p>

<h4>Kindness Week &amp; Racial Harmony Day 2025</h4>
<p>We began Kindness Week with a Mass Assembly, where children were introduced
to the theme of kindness and what it means to show care and respect for
others. Throughout the week, our children took part in a variety of meaningful
and fun activities — from creating their very own Singa the Kindness Lion
craft, to contributing items for our Donation Drive in support of the Singapore
Children’s Society. Children and parents also shared heartfelt messages
during our Kindness Trail, where handwritten notes of encouragement and
appreciation were displayed on our Kindness Trail Board for everyone to
enjoy.</p>
<p>To conclude the week, we celebrated Racial Harmony Day, embracing the
values of kindness, respect, and understanding among different cultures.
The children explored ethnic game booths, enjoyed snack tasting from various
ethnic groups, and came dressed in beautiful traditional costumes. The
highlight of the celebration was the delightful Kindsville Puppet Show,
which left everyone smiling and inspired to continue spreading kindness
every day.</p>
<p>Special shoutout to our K2 children who performed for Harmony Fest!’25
in celebration of Racial &amp; Religious Harmony Month!</p>

<h4>National Day 2025</h4>
<p>Our MK children celebrated National Day in school dressed in vibrant red
and white. They learnt about Singapore’s journey of progress and the significance
of SG60, singing the National Anthem proudly. We then headed to Waterway
Primary School’s hall for a joyful combined celebration with the primary
school students. We danced, sang, and waved our flags with pride! Happy
birthday, Singapore!</p>

<h4>Children’s Day 2025</h4>
<p>Happy Children’s Day! Our children had a blast with a special 2-day celebration
where there’s balloon sculpting, bouncy castles, roving art trucks, magic
show, movies and popcorn. The children came dressed up in their favourite
outfits and ended the celebration with special presents and big smiles
all around. A huge thank you to our wonderful parent volunteers who joined
in and became balloon artists for the day!</p>
