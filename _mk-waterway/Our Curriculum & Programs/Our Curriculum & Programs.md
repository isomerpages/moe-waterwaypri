<p><strong>Our Curriculum</strong>
</p>
<p>The MK curriculum is designed by preschool specialists to nurture children
holistically to be confident, possess strong social skills and have a good
foundation in literacy and numeracy.</p>
<p></p>
<p>All MOE Kindergartens (MKs) offer the same curriculum and flagship programmes,
and focus on:
<br>•Holistic development.
<br>•Integrated and active learning.
<br>•Learning through purposeful play and quality interactions.
<br>•Developing confidence and social skills.
<br>•Building a good foundation in literacy and numeracy.
<br>•Nurturing bilingualism in English and Mother Tongue Language (i.e. Chinese,
Malay and Tamil languages).</p>
<p></p>
<p>All MKs offer the three Mother Tongue Languages (MTLs) – Chinese, Malay
and Tamil – to encourage bilingualism in the early years and help lay a
strong foundation for language learning in the later years MKs will work
closely with their primary schools to smoothen and ease children's transition
from Kindergarten to Primary 1 (P1).</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Our Curriculum Goals</strong>
<br>Our curriculum and programmes are based on the Nurturing Early Learners
(NEL) Framework that guides the development of kindergarten programmes
in Singapore.</p>
<p></p>
<p>At MK, we believe preschool children are curious, active and competent
learners. They’re keen to make sense of the world around them, and they
learn best through active learning.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We strive to make learning authentic and relevant for your child through
activities with a distinctive Singapore flavour.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Each MK class comprises up to 20 children, divided into smaller groups
for specific activities.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In place of giving workbooks or worksheets as homework, we encourage family-based
learning activities that you and your child can engage in together. This
will help you bond with your child and share the joy of their growth and
learning.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Our Programmes</strong>
<br>Our curriculum comprises 2 flagship programmes, the HI-Light Programme
and Starlight Literacy Programme for English and Mother Tongue Language
(MTL). In addition, each term at MK will conclude in a Weeks of Wonder
project.</p>
