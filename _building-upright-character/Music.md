## Music

**Aim: Enjoyment and appreciation for all, talent and interest development for some**

Our students’ learning of Music @ Waterway Primary begins with singing and movement in the earlier years to picking up instrument playing skills on the recorder, ukulele and keyboard before consolidating their 6 years of learning by collaborating with friends to put up a performance in ‘The Music Showcase’ before their graduation. 

  

Here at Waterway Primary, we aim to develop in our students;

1. An awareness of and appreciation for music locally and globally
2. The ability for creative expression through music

  

Students will learn musical elements and concepts through the 3Es - Experience, Explore and Experiment during their lessons. They participate actively in hands-on activities, hone their listening skills and unleash their creativity in improvising and composing their own music, in both individual and group settings. There are also opportunities for students to perform and hence, build their confidence to showcase their musicality in front of an audience.
