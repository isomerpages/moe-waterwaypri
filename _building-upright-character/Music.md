&gt;LEARNING EXPERIENCES

## Music

The Music department believes that every child possesses innate musical qualities to be harnessed and developed. These aural and expressive abilities empower our students to appreciate and participate in musical experiences that enhance and enrich themselves and about the world. 

Our programs are crafted to provide our students with experiences to acquire and apply musical skills, knowledge and understanding through listening, creating and performing. It is an enjoyment and appreciation for all, and talent and interest development for some.
 
We aim to develop in our students an awareness of and appreciation of music locally and globally by engaging with songs. They learn musical elements and concepts through the 3Es â€“ Experience, Explore and Experiment. These active hands-on experiences hone their musical communication skills, creativity, critical thinking and collaboration among peers.
 
Music @ Waterway Primary begins with singing and movement in the earlier years to picking up instrument-playing skills on the recorder, ukulele and xylophone, as well as creating music. Students who are passionate and have keen interest or talented in Music will be provided with other platforms for development such as internal (S!NG@WAP) / external music competitions or performances (Singapore Youth Festival). 

Our annual WAP Centrestage provides a platform for our talented budding musicians/ artistes to showcase their performance in terms of singing, dancing and instrumental playing. These allows the whole school to share and celebrate the music achievements together as a big community.

We empower our students to make well-informed music choices through the activities in our programmes (eg: P2 Performing Arts (PA) CCA Module, Project Local Composers) so that they can become active contributors through music as well.
