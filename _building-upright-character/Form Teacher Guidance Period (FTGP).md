## Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP)

Form Teachers play a critical role in shaping the hearts and minds of our students. The Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP) is one of the strategies to create purposeful student-teacher interactions that allow teachers to identify the needs of the individual student and provide him/her with better support. It is a key platform for students to
learn values and social emotional skills explicitly and have opportunities to apply and reinforce their learning.

The activities, reflections and discussions during the lessons also help strengthen positive Teacher-Student Relationships (TSR) and build supportive peer relationships. Topics related to the six CCE content areas (i.e. Cyber Wellness, Education and Career Guidance, Family Education, Mental Health, National Education, and Sexuality Education) are explored and discussed in a developmentally appropriate manner during the lessons. Students also take part in Values-in-Action (VIA) Projects during CCE FTGP lessons. As part of VIA, students have opportunities to learn and care about Singapore, demonstrate active citizenship, learn skills and values related to working in groups and
interacting with others in the public sphere. 

Parents are the first care-givers in developing good character of their children. The development of character and citizenship dispositions in our students is influenced by what happens in school, in the family and in the wider community. There is active partnership between school and home when what is taught and learnt in school is reinforced at home. “Family Time” in the CCE (FTGP) lessons provide suggestions for activities which allow parents to bond with their children and
support their children’s development. These activities, such as “Family Chat Time!” and “Family Activities” also enable parents to partner with schools in this meaningful journey of supporting your child/ward in his/her learning of social-emotional competencies and values.
