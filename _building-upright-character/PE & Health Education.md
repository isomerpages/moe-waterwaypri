## PE & Health Education

**Aim: Healthy bodies and mind; Positive lifelong attitude towards health and exercise**

  

Our PE programme aims to develop studentsâ€™ psychomotor skills, control and co-ordination at the lower primary level. At the upper primary level, students are exposed to a wide range of activities such as games, athletics, dance and swimming as further development and refinement of fundamental movements and psychomotor skills. As the students become more competent in their psychomotor skills, they will be exposed to specific game-like situations that require critical decision-making. PE, together with Health Education, promotes a healthy diet and a positive lifelong attitude towards health and exercise.
