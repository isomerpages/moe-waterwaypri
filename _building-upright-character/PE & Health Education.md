## PE &amp; Health Education

**Aim: Healthy bodies and mind; Positive lifelong attitude towards health and exercise**

Physical Education is a vital component for our students. It benefits their overall health, including physical fitness, cardiometabolic health and mental health.

The PE Programme in Waterway Primary aims to develop our studentsâ€™ psychomotor skills, control and coordination at the lower primary level. At the upper primary level, students are exposed to a wide range of physical activities such as games, athletics, dance and swimming. This will further develop and refine the fundamental movements and psychomotor skills. 
As the students become more competent, they will be exposed to specific game-like situations that require critical decision-making.
