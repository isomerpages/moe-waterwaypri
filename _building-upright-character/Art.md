## Art

**Aim: Enjoyment and appreciation for all, talent and interest development for some**

  

Art plays an important role in our childrenâ€™s growth and development. It develops the creative abilities of individuals and challenges our children to think out of the box and develop new perspectives of looking at things. 

The Art Programme in Waterway Primary provides our students opportunities to express and create artworks, observe, and perceive the world around them with greater awareness and sensitivity and be a visually literate and confident communicator of Art.

Students who are passionate, have keen interest or talent in Art will be provided with other platforms for development such as participation in Singapore Youth Festival Art Exhibition (SYF AE), various internal and external art competitions and collaboration opportunities.
