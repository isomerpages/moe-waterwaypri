Eco Stewardship @ WAPS’ theme – *Protecting Waterways, Celebrating Biodiversity* is inspired by Punggol Town’s unique agricultural heritage and Waterfront Eco-Town identity. Building on our town’s heritage and identity, our programme has a unique focus on water and biodiversity conservation. Through classroom lessons, school activities and outdoor learning experiences, our students will learn and be given opportunities to, 

1.	Conserve and protect water resources
2.	Conserve and promote biodiversity

The programme also builds on the school’s Growth & Benefit Mindset (GBM) programme. It provides platforms for students to develop and practice applying the growth and benefit mindset that they have acquired through GBM lessons. 

Besides engaging students in school, the programme seeks to involve all its stakeholders (i.e. staff, parents and community partners) in developing and enhancing the 4Cs:

*	Curriculum 	- Infuse lessons on sustainability into current school curriculum   
*	Campus  	- Enhance campus with sustainability features 
*	Culture 	- Promote and encourage sustainable habits and practices
*	Community 	- Leverage community partners to provide students with authentic learning partnership opportunities

The programme adopts a 3-tiered approach to raise awareness, encourage actions and advocacy. 
*	**Tier 1** focuses on promoting school-wide approaches to sustainability
*	**Tier 2** focuses on level-specific sustainability programmes
*	**Tier 3** focuses on developing students ambassadors who will champion our sustainability programmes
