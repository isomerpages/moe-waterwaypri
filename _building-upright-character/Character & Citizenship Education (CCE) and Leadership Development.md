## Character & Citizenship Education (CCE) and Leadership Development


**Aim: Citizens of sound values and good character**

  

Our character and leadership development programme is anchored on our values of Responsibility, Integrity, Self-discipline and Empathy (RISE). We want students to be gracious citizens – confident, well-mannered and kind.

  

The programme adopts a “Head-Heart- Hands” approach.

  

**Head** – Values are taught explicitly and imparted through platforms such as Form Teacher Guidance Period, Character and Citizenship Education lessons conducted in Mother Tongue languages, Social Studies lessons, Morning Pre-assembly programmes, Assembly programmes and values infusion in subjects.

  

**Heart** –We win our students’ hearts over through bonding activities such as festive celebrations, National Education events and sharing to inspire hope and instil pride.

  

**Hands** –Students practise values through their participation in Co-curricular Activities (CCA), Programme for Active Learning (PAL), Values-in- Action (VIA)/ Service Learning activities and National Education events.

  

We believe that every student can lead, can serve and can succeed. A leader is more than gaining a following. True leadership involves service, treating others with respect and putting the needs of others before our own. Every student will be given opportunities to serve. We believe in developing every child to be the best that he or she can be.
