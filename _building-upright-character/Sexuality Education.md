<h2>Sexuality Education</h2>
<h5>MOE Sexuality Education in Schools</h5>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sexuality Education (SEd) in schools
aims to enable students to understand the physiological, social and emotional
changes they experience as they mature, develop healthy and rewarding relationships
with others, including those with members of the opposite sex, and make
wise, informed and responsible decisions on sexuality matters.</p>
<p>SEd is premised on the importance of the family as the basic unit of society.
This means encouraging healthy, heterosexual marriages and stable nuclear
family units with extended family support. The teaching and learning of
SEd is based on respect for the values and beliefs of the different ethnic
and religious communities in Singapore on sexuality issues.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <strong>Goals</strong> of Sexuality
Education are:</p>
<p>(a) Support students in managing their physiological, social and emotional
changes as they grow up and develop safe and healthy relationships.</p>
<p></p>
<p>(b) Guide students to make wise, informed and responsible decisions on
sexuality matters.</p>
<p></p>
<p>(c) Help students develop a moral compass and respect for themselves and
others by having positive mainstream values and attitudes about sexuality
that are premised on the family as the basic unit of society.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <strong>Key Messages</strong> of
Sexuality Education are:</p>
<p></p>
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Love and
respect yourself as you love and respect others;</p>
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Build
positive relationships based on love and respect (which are the foundation
for strong families);</p>
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Make responsible
decisions for yourself, your family and society; and</p>
<p>Abstinence before marriage is the best protection against STIs/HIV and
unintended pregnancies. Casual sex can harm and hurt you and your loved
ones.</p>

<h5><strong><u>Sexuality Education Lessons</u></strong></h5>
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The upper primary years mark the
onset of puberty. With better nutrition and improved health care, children
are reaching puberty at a younger age and have to grapple with physical,
emotional and psychological changes in themselves. The implication is that
our children are becoming biologically ready for sexual activity sooner
without necessarily having the corresponding cognitive or emotional maturity
to modulate their behaviours.</p>
<p>Furthermore, our young are also exposed to a wide range of influences
that could endanger health and undermine the integrity of the family. Our
students require guidance so that they can respond with discernment to
the sexual messages in the media and other sources.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sexuality Education (SEd) lessons
are taught as part of CCE (FTGP) at Primary 5 and 6. Through these lessons,
students will learn healthy ways to manage the physiological, social and
emotional changes in their growing years. They learn to build healthy and
rewarding relationships with others, including those with members of the
opposite sex. Students are also guided to make wise, informed and responsible
decisions to keep themselves safe from sexuality-related risks.</p>
<h5>At Waterway Primary School, the following the following Sexuality Education lessons will be taught in&nbsp;2026:</h5>
